First Time Deposit
The report is available as a set of diagrams presenting information about first-time deposits made by clients.
Filters
Data requested for the report can be filtered. Specify the following parameters before requesting a report in the manager terminal:
  * Groups — the report will be generated for accounts from the specified groups. You can specify one or several groups separating them by commas.
  * Period — starting and ending date of the period, for which the report will be generated.

Charts in the report
The report includes three types of charts:
  * FTD — the average value of clients' first deposits.
  * FTD Amount — the total amount of clients' first-time deposits over the selected period.
  * FTD Count — the number of clients' first-time deposits over the selected period.

The first-time deposit is registered per client. A client may have multiple trading accounts, so the report will reflect only one deposit (the first one) on one of these accounts.
In addition to the diagram type, you can select from various distribution options based on different parameters:
  * Lead Campaign — the name of an advertising campaign by which the client was attracted.
  * Lead Source — the website from which the client came.
  * Country — the client's country of residence.
  * Value — first-time deposit (different ranges).

  * Balance operation values reflected in charts are automatically converted to the same currency in accordance with current quotes. The report currency is configured on the trade server side.

  * Lead Campaign and Lead Source data are available in appropriate fields of [trading accounts](imtuser_leadcampaign.md "LeadCampaign").
