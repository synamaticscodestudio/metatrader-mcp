.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
string IMTConServer::AdaptersNext( uint pos // Position of the network controller )  
---

Parameters
pos
[in] Position of a network controller in the list, starting with 0.
Return Value
If successful, it returns a pointer to a string with the name of the network controller. Otherwise, it returns NULL.
Note
The pointer to the resulting string is valid for the lifetime of the [IMTConServer](imtconserver.md "IMTConServer") object.
To use the string after the object removal (call of the [IMTConServer::Release](imtconserver_release.md "Release") method of this object), a copy of it should be created.
The length of the controller name is limited to 128 characters (including the end-of-line character).
