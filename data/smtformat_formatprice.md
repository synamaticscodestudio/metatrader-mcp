SMTFormat::FormatPrice
Format a number into a string. Basic and additional accuracy are separately set for a number. As a rule, is used to format the position price.
static LPCWSTR SMTFormat::FormatPrice( CMTStr &str, // Reference to a string object double val, // Number UINT digits, // Number of decimal places UINT extra_digits=0 // Number of additional decimal places )  
---  
Parameters
&str
[out] Reference to the string object [CMTStr](cmtstr.md "CMTStr"), into which number is placed.
val
[in] The number being formated.
digits
[in] The basic number of digits after the decimal point in the formatted number.
extra_digits=0
[in] Additional accuracy for the number. Zero values ​​within the additional fractional part are omitted.
Return Value

Note
The method works in the same as [SMTFormat::FormatDouble](smtformat_formatdouble.md "FormatDouble"), but the accuracy for the number is given in two values: digits + extra_digits. In the additional fractional part (extra_digits) zero values are omitted. The basic fractional part is shown as is. For example:
  * As a result of execution of SMTFormat::FormatPrice(1.254,2,3) we receive a string 1.254 (general accuracy is 5 digits, but after the third digit 0 is omitted).
  * As a result of SMTFormat::FormatPrice (1.24500,4,1) we receive 1.2450.
