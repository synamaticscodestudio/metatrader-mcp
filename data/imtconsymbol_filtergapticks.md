IMTConSymbol::FilterGapTicks
Get the number of ticks for disabling the gap mode. If no new gap occurs within the specified number of quotes, the mode is disabled.
C++
UINT IMTConSymbol::FilterGapTicks() const

.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
uint CIMTConSymbol.FilterGapTicks()

Python (Manager API)
MTConSymbol.FilterGapTicks

Return Value
The number of ticks for disabling the gap mode. If no new gap occurs within the specified number of quotes, the mode is disabled.
Note
The number includes the tick, on which the gap started. For example, suppose that we have the values of 100 points and 3 ticks. When a gap is detected, the tick counter is increased by 1. If no new price spike for the specified number of points occurs at the two subsequent ticks, the gap mode will be disabled at the next (fourth) tick:
  * The first tick, on which a gap occurred. The tick counter is set to 1.
  * The second tick without a gap. The tick counter is increased to 2. It is the first tick, which confirms the new price.
  * The third tick without a gap. The tick counter is increased to 3. It is the second tick, which confirms the new price.
  * The fourth tick without a gap. It is the third tick, which confirms the new price. The gap mode is switched off.

IMTConSymbol::FilterGapTicks

Parameters
ticks
[in] The number of ticks for disabling the gap mode. If no new gap occurs within the specified number of quotes, the mode is disabled.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred that corresponds to the response code.
Note
The number includes the tick, on which the gap started. For example, suppose that we have the values of 100 points and 3 ticks. When a gap is detected, the tick counter is increased by 1. If no new price spike for the specified number of points occurs at the two subsequent ticks, the gap mode will be disabled at the next (fourth) tick:
  * The first tick, on which a gap occurred. The tick counter is set to 1.
  * The second tick without a gap. The tick counter is increased to 2. It is the first tick, which confirms the new price.
  * The third tick without a gap. The tick counter is increased to 3. It is the second tick, which confirms the new price.
  * The fourth tick without a gap. It is the third tick, which confirms the new price. The gap mode is switched off.
