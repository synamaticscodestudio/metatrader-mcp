Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error corresponding to the response code has occurred.
Note
Once the limit is reached, the client will no longer be able to place new pending orders If the value is not specified (0), a limit defined at the group level ([IMTConGroup::LimitOrders](imtcongroup_limitorders.md "LimitOrders")) will be used. If limits are set both at the account and at the group level, the stricter one of them will be applied.
