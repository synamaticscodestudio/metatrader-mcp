IMTTickSink::OnTickStat
A handler of the event of update of the statistical information about a price.
C++
virtual void IMTTickSink::OnTickStat( const MTTickStat& tstat // A reference to a structure of the description of statical information )  
---  
.NET (Manager API)
virtual void CIMTTickSink.OnTickStat( MTTickStat tstat // A structure of the description of statical information )  
---  
Parameters
tstat
[in] A reference to the structure that describes statistical price information ([MTTickStat](mttickstat.md "MTTickStat")).
Note
The event is called after information is saved in the database for this symbol. This means that the statistical information has been received from the current data feed used for the symbol in accordance with the priority (as determined by the position of the data source (gateway/data feed) in the configuration list) and has passed all checks for correctness.
In Manager API, the event is only called for the symbols which have been added to the [list of selected symbols](imtmanagerapi_selected.md "Selected Symbols").
IMTTickSink::OnTickStat
A handler of the event of update of the statistical price information with the specification of a data source.
C++
virtual void IMTTickSink::OnTickStat( const int feeder, // The index of the data feed const MTTickStat& tstat // A reference to a structure of the description of statical information )  
---  
.NET (Manager API)
virtual void CIMTTickSink.OnTickStat( int feeder, // The index of the data feed MTTickStat tstat // A structure of the description of statical information )  
---  
Parameters
feeder
[in] The index of the data source, from which statical information is received.
tstat
[in] A reference to the structure that describes statistical price information ([MTTickStat](mttickstat.md "MTTickStat")).
Note
This method is used only in the MetaTrader 5 Server API and is called only on the history servers.
The event is called after information is saved in the database for this symbol. This means that the statistical information has been received from the current data feed used for the symbol in accordance with the priority (as determined by the position of the data source (gateway/data feed) in the configuration list) and has passed all checks for correctness.
Identifying the data source based on the feeder index
The type of the data source, from which the information has been received, is determined in accordance with the constants defined in the [EnMTFeederConstants](mttick.htm#enmtfeederconstants) enumeration:
  * The MT_FEEDER_DEALER (-1) value means that the information was added manually through a manager terminal or API.
  * A value from 0 to 63 (MT_FEEDER_OFFSET - 1) means that the information was received from a gateway.
  * A value of 64 (MT_FEEDER_OFFSET) or greater means that the information was received from a data feed.

After determining the type of data source ([gateway](config_gateway.md "Gateways") or [data feed](config_datafeeds.md "Data Feeds")), we can analyze a certain value. The index corresponds to the position of the data feed/gateway, from which the information was received, in the list of configurations at the time of tick arrival. For example, index 0 means that the information was received from the first gateway in the list of gateway configurations. Value of 65 means that the information was received from the second data feed in the list of data feed configurations.
