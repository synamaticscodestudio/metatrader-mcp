Positions History Report
Positions History Report is a summary report on positions for the selected period.
The platform does not explicitly store the history of positions. The history is presented based on deals executed for the selected period. The platform collects data on deals related to a position (position opening, additional volume, partial and full closure), and then combines the data into one record.
The report only shows the positions that were closed during the selected period. If the position is still open or its close time does not fall within the selected interval, it will not be displayed in history.

  * Groups — the groups containing the accounts, on which the report must be created. You can specify one or several accounts separating them by commas.
