IMTUser::Name
Get the name of a client.
C++
LPCWSTR IMTUser::Name() const  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
string CIMTUser.Name()  
---  
Return Value
If successful, it returns a pointer to a string with the name of a client. Otherwise, it returns NULL.
Note
The pointer to the resulting string is valid for the lifetime of the [IMTUser](imtuser.md "IMTUser") object.
To use the string after the object removal (call of the [IMTUser::Release](imtuser_release.md "Release") method of this object), a copy of it should be created.
IMTUser::Name
Set the name of a client.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTUser::Name( LPCWSTR name // Name of a client )  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTUser.Name( string name // Name of a client )  
---  
Parameters
name
[in] The name of a client.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred, which corresponds to the response code.
Note
The maximum length of a client's symbol name is 128 characters (including the end-of-line character). If a string of a greater length is assigned, it will be cut to this length.
How the method is used in the trading platform version 2265 and higher
The method is considered obsolete starting with the [platform version 2265](https://support.metaquotes.net/en/news/3110). The field was previously used for specifying the full name of the client. Now, three separate fields are used for specifying the name, the middle name and the last name: [IMTUser::FirstName](imtuser_firstname.md "FirstName"), [IMTUser::MiddleName](imtuser_middlename.md "MiddleName") and [IMTUser::LastName](imtuser_lastname.md "LastName").
In version 2265 and above, data can be received via the IMTUser::Name get-method as follows:
  * If the broker uses the previously adopted procedure and only the IMTUser::Name field is filled in a record, its value will be passed as a result.
  * If the broker has switched to the new system and the new fields LastName and MiddleName are filled in a record, the combined string "[IMTUser::Name] [IMTUser::MiddleName] [IMTUser::LastName]" will be returned as a result.

Thus the method always returns a correct value, no matter what system is used by the broker.
When using a set-method, the passed value is written to the IMTUser::Name property. In this case, the IMTUser::MiddleName and IMTUser::LastName values are forcibly deleted. Let us consider the reasons for this:
  * You set the full name using the old IMTUser::Name method.
  * If any values were left in the IMTUser::MiddleName and IMTUser::LastName field, then upon a call of the IMTUser::Name get-method you would receive the combined string "[IMTUser::Name] [IMTUser::MiddleName] [IMTUser::LastName]".
  * Since new fields are cleared upon the set-method call, the get-method will only return the previously set name value.

This ensures a correct operation with the platform data using old and new data.
