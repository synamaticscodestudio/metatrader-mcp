IMTReportAPI::TickHistoryGetRaw
Get raw quotes (not processed prices in accordance with the configuration of the symbol) for a symbol in the specified time range.
MTAPIRES IMTReportAPI::TickHistoryGetRaw( LPCWSTR symbol, // Symbol const INT64 from, // Start date const INT64 to, // End date MTTickShort*& ticks, // A pointer to the array of structures of quotes UINT& ticks_total // Number of quotes )  
---  
Parameters
symbol
[in] The name of the symbol, for which you need to get quotes.
from
[in] The start date for requesting quotes. The date is specified in seconds since January 1, 1970.
to
[in] The end date for requesting quotes. The date is specified in seconds since January 1, 1970.
ticks
[out] A pointer to the array of structures that describe quotes ([MTTickShort](mttickshort.md "MTTickShort")).
ticks_total
[out] The total number of received quotes.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred that corresponds to the response code.
Note
Reports work on trade server, and the history data is requested from the databases of the history server. Note, that each call of the method leads to a network request to the history server. Frequent calls of the method may decrease the performance. 
If the option of storing raw prices is disabled in symbol settings ([IMTConSymbol::TICK_COLLECTRAW](imtconsymbol_enum.htm#entickflags)), the method will always return 0 quotes.
After being used, the array of structures [MTTickShort](mttickshort.md "MTTickShort") must be released using the [IMTServerAPI::Free](imtreportapi_free.md "Free") method.
