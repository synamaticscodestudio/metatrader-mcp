Format of Commands
Web API commands are passed using standard POST and GET requests:
  * Command names and their parameters fully coincide with the [Web API protocol](webapi_main.md "Manager Interface \(Rest API\)").
  * Command parameters are specified after ? and are separated using &.
  * An additional request body is passed in the JSON format.
  * The domain connected with the access server's public point is specified as the host.
  * Contents type in the request: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

The command can be schematically represented as follows:
GET /command?param1=value1&param2=value2&... Host: {domain bound to public address} Accept: */* User-Agent: MetaTrader 5 Web API/5.2005 (Windows NT 6.2; x64) Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded { ... } POST /command?param1=value1&param2=value2&... Host: {domain bound to public address}  Accept: */* User-Agent: MetaTrader 5 Web API/5.2005 (Windows NT 6.2; x64) Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded { ... }  
---  
The following data is specified in the request:
  * Host — the domain with which the public point of the access server is connected.
  * command — the name of the [command](webapi_main.md "Manager Interface \(Rest API\)")
  * param1, value1, ... — additional parameters if they are used for this command.
  * { ... } — additional request body as a text in the JSON format if it is provided for the specified command. For example, when using the [/api/user/add](webapi_user_add.md "Add") command, the created account parameters are passed in the additional body. Some of the parameters are case-sensitive, for example, the [LeadSource and LeadCampaign](webapi_user_data_structure.md "Data Structure") fields of the trading account. Because of this, field names in a JSON body must always be passed in the case specified in the documentation. For example, the entry { ... "LEADCAMPAIGN":"website_ad" ... } is incorrect. The correct specification is { ... "LeadCampaing":"website_ad" ... }.

The response from the server is passed in the JSON format. The response code is always passed as the first parameter, which is followed by additional information.
{ "retcode" : "retcode", "answer" : { "param1" : "value1", "param2" : "value2", ... } }  
---  
For example, in response to the [/api/user/get](webapi_user_get.md "Get by Login") command, you will receive the response code and data concerning the requested user.
  * Commands, parameters and the server response are passed in the Unicode (UTF-8) format.

  * All commands should be passed in the same session during and after the authentication.
