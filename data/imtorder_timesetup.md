An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred, which corresponds to the response code.
Note
If the value of this field is specified, the [IMTOrder::TimeSetupMsc](imtorder_timesetupmsc.md "TimeSetupMsc") value will be filled in automatically.
