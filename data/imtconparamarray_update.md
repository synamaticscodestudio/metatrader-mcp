IMTConParamArray::Update
Changes a parameter at the specified position of an array.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTConParamArray::Update( const UINT pos, // Position IMTConParama* param // Parameter object )  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTConParamArray.Update( uint pos, // Position CIMTConParama param // Parameter object )  
---  
Parameters
pos
[in] Position of a daily report in an array, starting with 0.
param
[in] Parameter object.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred that corresponds to the response code.
Note
The IMTConParamArray::Update method deletes the previous element (call of [IMTConParam::Release](imtconparam_release.md "Release")) and replaces it with a new one. After that, the lifetime of a new element is controlled by an array object. Thus, when deleting an array object (call of IMTConParamArray::Release), an earlier inserted object will be automatically removed.
In turn, the removal of a previously inserted object will cause the pointer to it, which is stored inside an array object, to be no longer valid. Therefore, call to this pointer (including the case of array object deletion) will cause crash of the application.
Never add a link to one and the same object in an array, because this will lead to a crash during memory release.
