Lifetime Value
The report presents the generalized LTV picture for accounts from a selected group, which were registered in a certain period.
The report enables the analysis of changes in the client's lifetime value over time, after account registration. Also, the report provides data on the amount and number of deposit operations. Select the distribution type for information display: by Lead Source, by Lead Campaign and by countries. Thus you can evaluate the real effectiveness of each advertising campaign and attraction channel.

  * Period — starting and ending date of the period, for which the report will be generated.

Charts in the report
The report includes multiple charts:
  * LTV by Lifetime and Lead Source / Lead Campaign / Country — the life-time value of accounts is presented with the distribution by Lead Source, Lead Campaign and Country (in three different charts). The lifetime value is calculated as (amount of deposits)/(number of deposits). For example, a period of 2018.08.01-2019.02.01 is selected for the report. The report retrieves data on accounts created during this period (taking into account specified group filtration parameters). The system calculates LTV for each month of account existence with the data accumulation: LTV for the first month, the first two months, the first three months, etc.
  * Deposits Amount by Lifetime and Lead Source / Lead Campaign / Country — deposit values over the entire lifetime, distributed by Lead Source, Lead Campaign and Country (in three different charts). Information is presented separately for each month of the account existence.
  * Deposits Count by Lifetime and Lead Source / Lead Campaign / Country — number of deposit operations over the entire lifetime, distributed by Lead Source, Lead Campaign and Country (in three different charts). Information is presented separately for each month of the account existence.
  * Inactive Clients Count by Lead Source / Lead Campaign / Country — the number of clients who did not make any deposit over the selected period, distributed by Lead Source, Lead Campaign and Country (in three different charts).

  * Balance operation values reflected in charts are automatically converted to the same currency in accordance with current quotes. The report currency is configured on the trade server side.

  * Lead Campaign and Lead Source data are available in appropriate fields of [trading accounts](imtuser_leadcampaign.md "LeadCampaign").
