EMIR Report
EMIR (European Market Infrastructure Regulation) is a regulation by European Parliament and Council of the European Union, which sets unified requirements for over-the-counter derivatives trading, aims at reducing related risks and trade reporting. EMIR came into force on August 16, 2012. For more details please visit the [ESMA website](https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/post-trading/trade-reporting).
One of the EMIR requirements concerns reporting derivative trades to licensed trade repositories. The standard "EMIR Reports" report is available in the platform package to assist brokers in meeting this requirement. It enables the automatic generation of reports in the appropriate format and sending them to the repository's FTP server.
Among all the repositories to which the reports can be sent, the largest and the most popular one is [CME Group](cme-european-trade-repository.md). MetaTrader 5 EMIR Reports are designed specifically for operations with this repository. The report specification is available at the [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/global-repository-services/technical-documentation.html#etr) website.
A Book and B Book trades in the report
The main difference in the trades presentation in the report concerns the number of rows corresponding to each of them. B Book deals which are processed directly in the MetaTrader 5 platform and not sent to external trading systems, are reflected in a single report table row. A Book deals are shown in two rows: one of them reflects the internal part of the deal between the trader and the broker (intermediary party) and the second row shows the external part between the broker and the external system (exchange). In other words, B Book trades have only the internal part, while an A Book trade consists of an internal and an external part.
In addition, some of the report fields are filled in different ways, depending on the deal part:
| Field | The B Book trade or the internal part of the A Book trade | External part of the A Book trade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NonReportingPartyIDType | Value "LEI", if the broker's client who has performed the trade is [marked](imtclient_enum.htm#enclienttype) as "Corporate" or "Fund". Value "CLC" for all other client types. | Value "LEI". |
| NonReportingPartyLEI | If "LEI" is specified in the NonReportingPartyIDType field, the value of "LEI number for EMIR reports" from the [client record](imtclient_companylei.md "CompanyLei") will be used. If "CLC" is specified in "NonReportingPartyIDType", the value is determined as follows (in order of priority): |

  * External client ID from [trading account settings](imtuser_externalaccountadd.md "ExternalAccountAdd").
  * Internal client ID, which is equal to the [client record](imtclient_recordid.md "RecordID") ID in MetaTrader 5.
  * Trading account ID, i.e. [account](imtuser_login.md "Login") login/number.

| LEI of the liquidity provider in accordance with the [gateway settings](emir_report.htm#gateway).  
NonReportingPartyCountry | The value is determined as follows:
  * For legal entities — from the "Registration country" field of the [client record](imtclient_companycountry.md "CompanyCountry").
  * For individuals — from the "Country" field of the [client record](imtclient_addresscountry.md "AddressCountry").

| The "EMIR Report Country" parameter value from the [gateway settings](emir_report.htm#gateway).  
UTI | Consists of three parts: [E02][LEI][Transaction ID]:
  * E02 — the first part always consists of these three characters.
  * LEI — broker's LEI from the "Broker LEI" parameter in the [plugin settings](emir_report.htm#install_plugin).
  * Transaction ID — [deal ticket](imtdeal_deal.md "Deal") in MetaTrader 5.

| Consists of three parts: [E02][LEI][Transaction ID]:
  * E02 — the first part always consists of these three characters.
  * LEI — liquidity provider's LEI from the [gateway settings](emir_report.htm#gateway).
  * Transaction ID — [deal ID in the external system](imtdeal_externalid.md "ExternalID").

  
ExecutionVenue | Value "XXXX". | The "EMIR Report MIC" parameter value from the [gateway settings](emir_report.htm#gateway).  
The detailed description of the report contents is provided in the "[Reported data](emir_report.htm#data)" section below.
Plugin Installation and Features
The report is implemented as the EMIR.Reports64.dll file combining two report modules and the server plugin:
  * The plugin collects data required for report sending via FTP, and saves this data in the trade server directory.
  * [Reports](emir_report.htm#install_report) enable the convenient view of information in the created files and the manual generation of relevant reports.

The EMIR.Reports64.dll file is included into the standard platform package and is located under the Reports directory of the MetaTrader 5 trading server.
The plugin generates the reports daily, based on previous-day data. Report creation time is set in the [plugin settings](emir_report.htm#install_plugin). Along with generation, the plugin can automatically send reports to the regulator's SFTP server, and thus you do not have to submit them manually. Report sending time and address are also specified in the settings.
The generated files are saved in the directory of the server for which the plugin is installed: [trading server installation directory]\Reports\EMIR.Reports\CME\Outbox. Once a file is sent to the SFTP server, it is moved from the "Outbox" folder to "Sent", located under the same directory.
To install the report, navigate to the Plugins section in MetaTrader 5 Administrator. After the server with the installed plugin has been selected, click 
The following parameters are available here:
  * Report Time — report generation time in the format of HH:MM:SS. This is the MetaTrader 5 trading platform site.
  * Symbol — sort by symbols. A comma separated list of symbols. The mask "*" and the negation sign "!" can be used here. For example, the value "EURUSD,GBPUSD" means that the plugin will collect information related to deals for EURUSD and GBPUSD symbols. The value "*" is for all symbols. *,!CFD\\* value is for all symbols except those in the CFD group.
  * Groups — sort by groups. A comma separated list of groups. The mask "*" and the negation sign "!" can be used here. For example, the value "demoforex,democfd" means that the plugin will collect the transaction details for users in demoforex and democfd groups. The value "*" is for all groups. The default value is "*,!demo*,!contest*" which means all groups except those whose names start with demo and contest.
  * Send Time — time when the report will be send to the regulator's FTP server, HH:MM:SS. This is the MetaTrader 5 trading platform site.
  * CME firm's SFTP account ID — broker's ID in the Secured FTP server of the repository, to which [reports will be uploaded](emir_report.htm#send). If the reports are to be sent manually, this field can be left blank.
  * SFTP Host — address for connecting to Secured FTP server. If the reports are to be sent manually, this field can be left blank.
  * SFTP Port — port for connecting to Secured FTP server. If the reports are to be sent manually, this field can be left blank.

  * 2.1 ContractType CD — symbol path mask, according to which it will be assigned to type "CD" (Financial contracts for difference). It is used to fill the "2.1 ContractType" field in the report. For example, if *\cfd\\* is specified in the parameter, then the "CD" value will be set in the "2.1 ContractType" field for all symbols, having \cfd\ in their path. For example, you can use this mask if contracts for difference in your platform are created in the CFD\, CME\CFD\, Real\CFD\Main\ and similar sections.
  * 2.1 ContractType FU — the same for the "FU" type (Futures).
  * 2.1 ContractType FW — the same for the "FW" type (Forwards).

  * Mail Login List — the list of manager logins, to which [report generation errors](emir_report.htm#errors) will be emailed.
  * Stop On Error — report generation mode in case [data is not enough](emir_report.htm#errors). If "Yes" (default), the report will not be generated if at least one of the fields has no data. If "No", the report will be generated even of there is missing data. The report fields having no data will be left empty. Additionally, the list of relevant errors will be added to the "Comment" field of each unfilled row.

  * Data from the plugin parameters is extracted at the report generation time and is not stored in deal details. If you change plugin parameters after the execution of the relevant deals but prior to report generation, then the new parameter values as of the report generation time will be used for the report.
  * For the detailed description of all report fields please visit the [ESMA](https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/post-trading/trade-reporting) site.

Handling Report Generation Errors
The report generation is based on data from different settings and databases of the platform, including trading accounts, client records and gateway settings. If any of the data is missing, the generation report will be interrupted by default, i.e. the report file will not be generated and will not be sent to the SFTP server. This prevents the sending of incorrect data to the trading repository.
There is the possibility to disable report generation interruption in case of missing data. To do this, set "No" in [Stop On Error](emir_report.htm#stop_error). In this case, the report generation will not be interrupted, but some of the report fields will be left blank. For example, if only client LEI is not available for a transaction, the transaction row in the report will have one field empty, while all other fields will be filled. In this case you can add the missing data manually and send the report to the repository.
Errors
All missing data errors are recorded to the trade server journal. To request relevant logs, use the "EMIR Reporter" and "EMIR CME Manual" keywords. Error reports are additionally [sent via the internal email system](emir_report.htm#notifications).
Data on encountered issues is also reflected in the reports. A brief description of errors which occurred when filling the fields is displayed in the Comment fields of appropriate report rows.
For [EMIR CME Manual](emir_report.htm#install_report) report, summary information is additionally shown in the last row. This includes the total number of rows in the report and the number of rows with missing data.
Notifications
After each report generation attempt, the plugin sends a message with the attempt results to managers, via the internal email system. The list of logins to whom the emails will be sent is specified in the [Mail Login List](emir_report.htm#mail) parameter of the plugin.
The email subject is "EMIR report automated generation status". It contains the following details:
  * If the report has been generated without errors, the email will contain the following message: "successfully generated X rows for the report by specification "CME"", where X is the number of records in the created report, excluding the table header.
  * If the report has been created, but one or more fields could not be filled, the email will contain the following: "generated X rows for the report by specification "CME", Y rows have warnings (see trade server log by keyword EMIR for details)". X — the number of report records excluding the table header, Y — the number of records with warnings. The warnings are displayed in the "Comment" column of appropriate rows in the table.
  * If the report could not be created, the email will state: "failed to generate report (see trade server log by keyword EMIR for details)". In this case, you should request the trade server journal using the "EMIR" keyword.

After each attempt to [upload a report to the FTP server](emir_report.htm#send), the plugin also sends notifications to managers from the "[Mail Login List](emir_report.htm#mail)" parameter. A separate email is generated for each sent file.
The email subject is "EMIR report uploading status". It contains the name of the file and its sending status:
  * When uploaded successfully, the message is "successfully uploaded".
  * If error occurs, one of the following statuses will be delivered depending on the error:
  * "internal error (see trade server log by keyword EMIR for details)" — the error could not be identified.
  * "failed to initialize SFTP connection (see trade server log by keyword EMIR for details)" — repository server connection error.
  * "failed to upload (see trade server log by keyword EMIR for details)" — file uploading error.

Configure gateways for reporting A-book transactions
For operations sent to external trading systems through gateways (operations with an external counterparty), additional information is indicated in the EMIR report:
  * ReportingPartyLEI — LEI of the reporting company. It is always filled with the "ReportingEntityLEI" parameter value from the [plugin settings](emir_report.htm#install_plugin).
  * BeneficiaryLEI — LEI of the company which acts as a beneficiary in the operation. It is always filled with the "ReportingEntityLEI" parameter value from the plugin settings.
  * NonReportingPartyLEI and NonReportingPartyCountry — LEI and country code of the counterparty.
  * ExecutionVenue — code of the execution venue (exchange) to which the gateway is connected.

Since the broker can work with different external systems, the values for these two parameters should be specified in the settings of the gateway via which the deals are forwarded.
Open the gateway settings and add the following parameters:
  * EMIR Report LEI — LEI of the liquidity provider to which the gateway is connected. Used to fill the NonReportingPartyLEI report field.
  * EMIR Report Country — code of liquidity provider's registration country. It is used in accordance with the [ISO 3166](iso-3166-country-codes.md) standard. Used to fill the NonReportingPartyCountry report field.
  * EMIR Report MIC — the code of the trading exchange to which the gateway is connected. It is indicated in accordance with the [ISO 10383](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/fr/#iso:std:iso:10383:ed-3:v1:en) standard. Used to fill the ExecutionVenue report field. If the parameter is not specified, the "XXXX" value will be inserted into the report field.

These parameters can be added to any gateway. They will only be used for the report and do not affect the gateway operation.
Data from the gateway parameters is extracted at the report generation time and are not stored in deal details. If you change gateway parameters after the execution of the relevant deals but prior to report generation, then the new parameter values as of the report generation time will be used for the report.

Report Installation
EMIR Report includes two report modules: EMIR CME Automated and EMIR CME Manual.
EMIR CME Automated
This report allows viewing data from the file [generated by the plugin](emir_report.htm#install_plugin). These include files from two directories
  * [trade server installation directory]\Reports\EMIR.Reports\CME\Outbox — the generated files which has not yet been sent
  * [trade server installation directory]\Reports\EMIR.Reports\CME\Sent — the files which were successfully sent to the repository

  * To start collecting information, the [plugin must be enabled](emir_report.htm#install_plugin) in the appropriate trade server settings. If the plugin is not enabled, report data will not be updated and the report will provide data only for the plugin operation period.
  * When the EMIR CME Automated report is used in the Manager terminal, no requests are sent to the server database. The report only presents data from the files generated by the plugin.

  
---  
EMIR CME Manual
This module enables manual report generation for any time frame. This feature can be useful if the automated report was not generated for any of the previous days, for some reason. Set the required time interval, request report generation from the Manager terminal, export the received data to file and upload it to the repository manually.
Unlike the Automated report, this mode does not access the generated files and does not depend on whether the [server plugin](emir_report.htm#install_plugin) is installed or not. The data is requested directly from the server database.
Installation
To install the reports, open the Reports section of MetaTrader 5 Administrator. After selecting a server for report installation, Add.
Once the configuration is added, select the required report in the Type field. No additional parameters are used for EMIR CME Automatic.
The set of parameters for the EMIR CME Manual almost coincides with [plugin](emir_report.htm#install_plugin) parameters. These values are used to fill the report.
  * Broker LEI — broker's Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), consists of a 20-digit alphanumeric code. The value is used in various fields of the report.
  * 1.6 CorporateSector — the sector in which the company operates. For example, F — an investment company, C — a credit company, etc. The value is directly substituted in the appropriate report field. The default value is F.
  * 1.7 FinancialOrNonFinancialCounterParty — type of the reporting company. For example, F — financial counterparty, N — non-financial counterparty, etc. The value is directly substituted in the appropriate report field. The default value is F.
  * 1.9 ReportingEntityLEI — Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) of the reporting entity. The value is directly substituted in the appropriate report field.
  * 2.1 ContractType CD — symbol path mask, according to which it will be assigned to type "CD" (Financial contracts for difference). It is used to fill the "2.1 ContractType" field in the report. For example, if *\cfd\\* is specified in the parameter, then the "CD" value will be set in the "2.1 ContractType" field for all symbols, having \cfd\ in their path. For example, you can use this mask if contracts for difference in your platform are created in the CFD\, CME\CFD\, Real\CFD\Main\ and similar sections.
  * 2.1 ContractType FU — the same for the "FU" type (Futures).
  * 2.1 ContractType FW — the same for the "FW" type (Forwards).
  * 2.1 ContractType OP — the same for the "OP" type (Option).
  * 2.1 ContractType SB — the same for the "SB" type (Spreadbet).
  * 2.1 ContractType SW — the same for the "SW" type (Swap).
  * 2.1 ContractType ST — the same for the "ST" type (Swaption).
  * 2.1 ContractType OT — the same for the "OT" (Other).
  * 2.2 AssetClass CO — symbol path mask, according to which it will be assigned to "CO" assets class (Commodity and emission allowances). It is used to fill the "2.2 AssetClass" field in the report. For example, if *\commodity\\* is specified in the parameter, then the "CO" value will be set in the "2.2 AssetClass" field for all symbols, having \commodity\ in their path. For example, you can use this mask if contracts for difference in your platform are created in the Commodity\, CME\Commodity\, Real\Commodity\Main\ and similar sections.
  * 2.2 AssetClass CR — the same for the "CR" class (Credit).
  * 2.2 AssetClass CU — the same for the "CU" class (Currency).
  * 2.2 AssetClass EQ — the same for the "EQ" class (Equity).
  * 2.2 AssetClass IR — the same for the "IR" class (Interest Rate).
  * 2.38 Intragroup — determines whether both counterparts of the deal belong to the same company. One of the two values : Y — belong to one company, N — do not belong. The value is directly substituted in the appropriate report field. The default value is N.

The Symbols and Groups parameters are not used here, since filtering by groups and symbols can be set when requesting a report from the Manager terminal.
Viewing the Reports
To view the report request, use MetaTrader 5 Manager. Simply select the necessary report in the Server Reports section to retrieve data from the server.
For report operation details, please visit the appropriate section of MetaTrader 5 Manager documentation.
The [plugin](emir_report.htm#install_plugin) access to server data is not restricted. To generate files, the plugin can use any available information on groups and symbols. In contrast, the EMIR CME Manual report has restricted access to data in accordance with the manager account permissions and settings of the group to which this account belongs.  
---  
Sending Reports to Repository
To send the reports to the repository, the corresponding files need to be uploaded to a special SFTP server. The EMIR Reports plugin is able to send reports to the server automatically. For this, you should specify report sending time and SFTP server connection details, in the [plugin settings](emir_report.htm#install_plugin).
Contact an appropriate repository to get SFTP access (address, login and password). For example, server access specifications for the CME Group are available at <https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/global-repository-services/files/ftp-connectivity.pdf>.
The plugin create file reports to be sent, in the [trade server installation directory]\Reports\EMIR.Reports\CME\Outbox. If sending to repository is not activated in [plugin settings](emir_report.htm#install_plugin) by the time of report generation (the "SFTP Host" field is empty), the files will be simply saved in this directory. Once you set the required settings, all the saved files will be uploaded to the repository at the next report sending time.
If sending to repository fails for any reason, its file is saved under [trade server installation directory]\Reports\EMIR.Reports\CME\Outbox. The next day the plugin will retry to send the file at the scheduled time.
Report Data
Some fields in the report are always empty. Data for this fields may not be available in MetaTrader 5 or may be optional. Only the fields marked in the specification as "FX only" or "All" are implemented in the report. Fields "Commodities only", "Credit only" and "Rates only" are not available, because they are not applicable in MetaTrader 5.
