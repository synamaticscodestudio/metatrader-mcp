MTGatewayInfo
MTGatewayInfo structure is used for setting a gateway/data feed module parameters. The structure is defined with the one-byte alignment.

Enumerations
This structure contains the following enumerations:
  * [EnModes](mtgatewayinfo.htm#enmodes)
  * [EnFields](mtgatewayinfo.htm#enfields)
