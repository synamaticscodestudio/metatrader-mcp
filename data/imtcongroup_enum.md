IMTConGroup::EnPermissionsFlags
Flags of group permissions are listed in IMTConGroup::EnPermissionsFlags.
| ID | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PERMISSION_NONE | 0x00000000 | No permissions. Default value. |
| PERMISSION_CERT_CONFIRM | 0x00000001 | Enable confirmation of certificates. |
| PERMISSION_ENABLE_CONNECTION | 0x00000002 | Allow client connections. |
| PERMISSION_RESET_PASSWORD | 0x00000004 | Forces users to change the master password during the first connection. Users will not be able to perform any actions before they change the password. |
| PERMISSION_FORCED_OTP_USAGE | 0x00000008 | In some countries, regulating institutions require the use of additional account security measures, such as the use of OTP. When this flag is enabled, all clients from the group will need to use one-time passwords for connection. Otherwise, clients can bind their accounts to the generator or use the default authentication method. Before you enable it, please inform your clients about the new OTP option. Be extremely careful enabling this option for the only one manager group on the trade server. The mobile terminal MetaTrader 5 for iPhone is used for generating passwords. |
| PERMISSION_RISK_WARNING | 0x00000010 | If the flag is enabled, when a client connects from the trading terminal, a warning about the risks associated with operations on the financial markets is displayed. Trade operations on a client's account are not allowed until the client confirms that he or she has read the warning and is aware of the risks. To confirm, the client should check "I am aware of the risks and I wish to trade in financial markets". This warning is displayed once per session of the terminal. The next time it appears after the restart of the terminal. The risk warning is not displayed for demo accounts. |
| PERMISSION_REGULATION_PROTECT | 0x00000020 | Enforce country-specific regulatory restrictions for retail clients. Every country has regulators — state bodies that supervise the activities of financial institutions (including brokers). Each regulator has its own set of requirements applied to trading currencies, securities and other instruments. In most cases, clients of brokerage firms are individuals from different countries. The platform provides the means of meeting the requirements of certain regulators without interfering with the work of traders not covered with these requirements. Restrictions applied to trader accounts depend on the client's country and other conditions set by that country's regulator. For example, the National Securities Market Commission (Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores) of Spain compels brokers to warn clients using the leverage of 1:10 or higher about potential risks in a special way. Therefore, if a client's country is Spain and they use a leverage of 1:10 or higher, an additional warning is displayed in the trading dialog Currently, only one regional limitation is used in the platform. The list is to be expanded later. |
| PERMISSION_NOTIFY_DEALS | 0x00000040 | Allow accounts to subscribe to [server push notifications ](https://support.metaquotes.net/en/docs/mt5/platform/administration/admin_groups/groups_settings#push) about deals. |
| PERMISSION_NOTIFY_ORDERS | 0x00000080 | Allow accounts to subscribe to server push notifications about orders. |
| PERMISSION_NOTIFY_BALANCES | 0x00000100 | Allow accounts to subscribe to server push notifications about balance operations. |

If this flag is enabled, clients from this group will only be able to subscribe to signals based on the accounts opened with the same broker. Signals from other accounts will not be displayed in trading terminals. |
| TRADEFLAGS_SO_COMPENSATION | 0x00000040 | Automatically execute on a client's account the special [DEAL_SO_COMPENSATION](imtdeal_enum.htm#endealaction) operation, which increases the balance and sets it to zero, if the balance has become negative after a position was closed by Stop Out. For more details please read the [MetaTrader 5 Administrator Help files](https://support.metaquotes.net/en/docs/mt5/platform/administration/admin_groups/groups_settings#compensate). |
| TRADEFLAGS_SO_FULLY_HEDGED | 0x00000080 | If the flag is enabled, then Stop out will be performed on accounts having open positions, the zero margin (positions are covered) and negative equity. If the option is disabled, orders and positions will not be forcibly closed in above cases. The flag can be only used on hedging accounts. ([IMTConGroup::MARGIN_MODE_RETAIL_HEDGED](imtcongroup_enum.htm#enmarginmode)). |
| TRADEFLAGS_FIFO_CLOSE | 0x00000100 | The position closing mode by FIFO rule. If the flag is enabled, then positions for each instrument can only be closed only in the order in which they were opened: the oldest one should be closed first, then the next one, etc. The option is only valid for hedging accounts, in which traders can have multiple positions for the same financial instrument. There are three main methods to close a position; the flag behavior will be different for each of the methods: |

  * Closing from the client terminal: the trader closes the position manually, using a trading robot, based on the Signals service subscription, etc. In case of an attempt to close a position, which does not meet the FIFO rule, the trader will receive an appropriate error.
  * Closing upon Stop Loss or Take Profit activation: these orders are processed on the server side, so the position closure is not requested on the trader (terminal) side, but is initiated by the server. If Stop Loss or Take Profit triggers for a position, and this position does not comply with the FIFO rule (there is an older position fro the same symbol), the position will not be closed. An appropriate message will be printed to the log: "position close prohibited by FIFO rule, position #100448219 buy 3.00 EURUSD 1.11544 sl: 1.11537 tp: 1.11549 take profit activation skipped".
  * Closing upon Stop Out triggering: such operations are also processed on the server side. In a normal mode, in which FIFO-based closing is disabled, in case of [Stop Out](https://support.metaquotes.net/en/docs/mt5/platform/administration/admin_groups/groups_settings#stopout_processing) positions are closed starting with the one having the largest loss. If this option option is enabled, the open time will be additionally checked for losing positions. The server determines losing positions for each symbol, finds the oldest position for each symbol, and then closes the one which has the greatest loss among the found positions.

  
TRADEFLAGS_HEDGE_PROHIBIT | 0x00000200 | Prohibit opening of opposite positions and placing of opposite orders. If this option is enabled, accounts are not allowed to have oppositely directed positions and orders for the same financial instrument. For example, if the account has a Buy position, then the user cannot open a Sell position or place a pending sell order for the same symbol. If such an attempt is made, the user will receive the [MT_RET_REQUEST_HEDGE_PROHIBITED](retcodes_trade_request.md "Trade Requests") error. The option is only valid for groups with the hedging position accounting mode ([IMTConGroup::MARGIN_MODE_RETAIL_HEDGED](imtcongroup_enum.htm#enmarginmode)).  
TRADEFLAGS_DEAL_COST | 0x00000400 | Calculate deal execution costs and display them in client terminals. All NFA regulated brokers should enable this option. For more details, please see [MetaTrader 5 Administrator documentation](https://support.metaquotes.net/ru/docs/mt5/platform/administration/admin_groups/groups_settings#deal_cost).  
TRADEFLAGS_SO_COMPENSATION_CREDIT | 0x00000800 | Works as an addition to the TRADEFLAGS_SO_COMPENSATION flag. If enabled, the credit funds on the account will be set to zero after a negative balance compensation operation. Credit funds are withdrawn in a separate balance operation with the [DEAL_SO_CREDIT_COMPENSATION](imtdeal_enum.htm#endealaction) type.  
TRADEFLAGS_ALL |  | End of enumeration. All flags are enabled.
