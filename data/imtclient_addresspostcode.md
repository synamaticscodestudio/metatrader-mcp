IMTClient::AddressPostcode
Get the client's zip code.
C++
LPCWSTR IMTClient::AddressPostcode() const  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
string CIMTClient.AddressPostcode()  
---  
Return Value
If successful, a pointer to a string with a zip code is returned. Otherwise, NULL is returned.
Note
The pointer to the resulting string is valid for the lifetime of the [IMTClient](imtclient.md "IMTClient") object.
To be able to use the string after the object removal (call of the [IMTClient::Release](imtclient_release.md "Release") method of this object), a copy of it should be created.
IMTClient::AddressPostcode
Set a client's zip code.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTClient::AddressPostcode( LPCWSTR postcode // Zip code )  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTClient.AddressPostcode( string postcode  // Zip code )  
---  
Parameters
postcode
[in] Client's zip code.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred, which corresponds to the response code.
Note
The zip code length is limited to 16 characters (including the end-of-line character). If a longer string is assigned, it will be trimmed up to this number of characters.
