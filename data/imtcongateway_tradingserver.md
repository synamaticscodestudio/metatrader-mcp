Return Value
If successful, it returns a pointer to a string with the address of the server to which the gateway connects. Otherwise, it returns NULL.
Note
The pointer to the resulting string is valid for the lifetime of the [IMTConGateway](imtcongateway.md "IMTConGateway") object.
To use the string after the object removal (call of the [IMTConGateway::Release](imtcongateway_release.md "Release") method of this object), a copy of it should be created.

Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred that corresponds to the response code.
Note
The maximum length of the address is 128 characters (including the sign of the string end). If a string of a greater length is assigned, it will be cut to this length.
