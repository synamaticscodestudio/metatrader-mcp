Report Configuration
In order for the server to start using the reports module, add its configuration via the Administrator terminal:
To add or change the configuration of the module, click 
Fill in the following fields in this window:
  * Enable — enable/disable the report. The module starts operating immediately after the option is enabled and the configuration is saved. To get started, server restart is not required.
  * Name — name of the report configuration. The same name is indicated in the report list of the Manager terminal.
  * Type — all reports available on the server are displayed here. The list is compiled based on the DLL report files which are located under the /report directory of the main trading server.
  * Trade server — to the right of the Name field, select a trade server the report is configured for. The report will be generated using the data on the specified server; and it will be available only when a manager connects to the specified server.

  * Each configuration of the report is bound to a specific server and thus generates reports concerning this server only.

  * Reports are generated for a manager in accordance with his or her access permissions. Reports are generated only for available groups of accounts.
