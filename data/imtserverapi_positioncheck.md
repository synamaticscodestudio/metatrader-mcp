IMTServerAPI::PositionCheck
Checking the correctness of a client's positions based on the history of deals.
MTAPIRES IMTServerAPI::PositionCheck( const UINT64 login, // The user's login IMTPositionArray* current, // Current positions IMTPositionArray* invalid, // Unmatched positions IMTPositionArray* missed, // Missing positions IMTPositionArray* nonexist // Odd positions )  
---  
Parameters
login
[in] The login of a user.
current
[out] An array of the client's current positions.
invalid
[out] During the check, the platform calculates what positions a client should have based on his history of trades. Calculated positions are compared with actual ones. If the calculate list contains positions that do not match actual positions, such records will be passed to the invalid array.
missed
[out] Positions that were calculated based on the client's history and that are not found among actual positions are placed into this array. In other words, missing positions are placed into the 'missed' array.
nonexist
[out] The client's actual positions that are not found in the calculated list based on the history of deals are added to this array. In other words, the client's odd positions that do not exist in the history are added to the 'nonexist' array.
Return Value
An indication of a successful check is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error code will be returned.
Disclaimer
The [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code does not indicate that the client;s positions are correct. Positions can be considered correct if you receive the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") code and empty 'invalid', 'missed' and 'nonexsit' arrays.
The 'current', 'invalid', 'missed' and 'nonexsit' array must be created beforehand using the [IMTServerAPI::PositionCreateArray](imtserverapi_positioncreatearray.md "PositionCreateArray") method.
If you need to correct positions based on the history of deals, you should use the [IMTServerAPI::PositionFix](imtserverapi_positioncreatearray.md "PositionCreateArray") method.
