MTReportInfo
The MTReportInfo structure is used for transmitting the primary data of a reports module to a server. The structure is defined with the one-byte alignment.
| #pragma pack(push,1) struct MTReportInfo { //--- databases snapshots flags enum EnSnapshots { SNAPSHOT_NONE =0x0, // Without a snapshot SNAPSHOT_USERS =0x1, // Requested users database snapshot SNAPSHOT_USERS_FULL =0x2, // A snapshot of the entire database of users SNAPSHOT_ACCOUNTS =0x4, // Requested accounts state snapshot SNAPSHOT_ACCOUNTS_FULL =0x8, // A snapshot of the entire database of trading accounts SNAPSHOT_ORDERS =0x10, // Requested orders database snapshot SNAPSHOT_ORDERS_FULL =0x20, // A snapshot of the entire database of orders SNAPSHOT_POSITIONS =0x40, // Requested positions database snapshot SNAPSHOT_POSITIONS_FULL=0x80, // A snapshot of the entire database of positions SNAPSHOT_NO_GROUPS_LOGINS=0x100, // Do not form a list of logins by groups //--- SNAPSHOT_ALL =SNAPSHOT_USERS | SNAPSHOT_ACCOUNTS | SNAPSHOT_ORDERS | SNAPSHOT_POSITIONS, SNAPSHOT_ALL_FULL =SNAPSHOT_USERS_FULL | SNAPSHOT_ACCOUNTS_FULL | SNAPSHOT_ORDERS_FULL | SNAPSHOT_POSITIONS_FULL,  }; //--- Types of reports enum EnTypes { TYPE_NONE =0x0, // Reports are not supported TYPE_HTML =0x1, // HTML report TYPE_TABLE =0x2, // Binary table //--- TYPE_ALL =TYPE_HTML | TYPE_TABLE }; //--- Internet Explorer minimum version enum EnIEVersion { IE_VERSION_ANY =0x0000, // Any version of IE IE_VERSION_9 =0x0900, // not older than IE 9 //--- IE_VERSION_FIRST =IE_VERSION_ANY, IE_VERSION_LAST =IE_VERSION_9, }; //--- Information about the module UINT version; // Module version UINT version_api; // Report API version UINT version_ie; // IE minimum version wchar_t name[64]; // Module name wchar_t copyright[128]; // Copyright wchar_t description[256]; // Description UINT snapshots; // Snapshots modes UINT types; // Types of reports wchar_t category[64]; // Report category MTReportParam params[64]; // Parameters of request UINT params_total; // Number of request parameters MTReportParam config[64]; // Module parameters UINT config_total; // Number of module parameters UINT reserved[64]; // A reserved field }; #pragma pack(pop) |

The structure is passed to the server via the [MTReportAbout](mtreportabout.md "MTReportAbout") entry point.
Enumerations
The structure contains the following enumerations:
  * [EnSnapshots](mtreportinfo.htm#ensnapshots)
  * [EnTypes](mtreportinfo.htm#entypes)
  * [EnIEVersion](mtreportinfo.htm#enieversion)

EnSnapshots
Possible modes for creating snapshots of databases when generating reports are enumerated in EnSnapshots. Database snapshots allow you to quickly save a particular database, which helps to avoid the discrepancy between the beginning and end of the report that may occur due to changes in the market environment during the report generation time.
| ID | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SNAPSHOT_NONE | 0x0 | No snapshots. |
| SNAPSHOT_USERS | 0x1 | A snapshot of the database of users [requested by a manager](reportapi_request.md "Request for Reports") during report generation. To request a report by groups/users, the report module must have the [MTReportParam::TYPE_GROUPS](mtreportparam.htm#enparamtype) parameter turned on. |
| SNAPSHOT_USERS_FULL | 0x2 | A snapshot of the entire database of users. |
| SNAPSHOT_ACCOUNTS | 0x4 | A snapshot of the database of trading accounts requested by a manager during report generation. To request a report by groups/users, the report module must have the [MTReportParam::TYPE_GROUPS](mtreportparam.htm#enparamtype) parameter enabled. |
| SNAPSHOT_ACCOUNTS_FULL | 0x8 | A snapshot of the entire database of trading accounts. |
| SNAPSHOT_ORDERS | 0x10 | A snapshot of the database of orders of clients requested by a manager during report generation. To request a report by groups/users, the report module must have the [MTReportParam::TYPE_GROUPS](mtreportparam.htm#enparamtype) parameter enabled. |
| SNAPSHOT_ORDERS_FULL | 0x20 | A snapshot of the entire database of orders. |
| SNAPSHOT_POSITIONS | 0x40 | A snapshot of the database of positions of clients requested by a manager during report generation. To request a report by groups/users, the report module must have the [MTReportParam::TYPE_GROUPS](mtreportparam.htm#enparamtype) parameter enabled. |
| SNAPSHOT_POSITIONS_FULL | 0x80 | A snapshot of the entire database of positions. |
| SNAPSHOT_NO_GROUPS_LOGINS | 0x100 | Disable automatic generation of a list of logins if a list of groups is passed in a report request. Many reports available in the platform package use the standard "Groups" parameter, indicating the list of groups for which a report should be generated. Every time when a report is generated with this parameter, the API generates the appropriate list of logins (it can be obtained via the [IMTReportAPI::ParamLogins](imtreportapi_paramlogins.md "ParamLogins") and [IMTReportAPI::KeySetParamLogins](imtreportapi_keysetparamlogins.md "KeySetParamLogins") methods). This is a time consuming operation. If your report can handle the "Groups" parameter directly, disabled the generation of the list of logins using the SNAPSHOT_NO_GROUPS_LOGINS flag and save computing resources. |
| SNAPSHOT_ALL |  | Enabling all eased snapshots of databases (only the data requested by a manager). |
| SNAPSHOT_ALL_FULL |  | Enabling all full snapshots of databases (*_FULL). |

EnTypes
Types of reports that can be supported by the module are enumerated in EnTypes:
| ID | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TYPE_NONE | 0x0 | None of the types is supported. |
| TYPE_HTML | 0x1 | Generation of HTML reports. |
| TYPE_TABLE | 0x2 | Generation of reports as binary tables. |
| TYPE_ALL |  | All types of reports are supported. |

This enumeration is used in the [IMTReportContext::Generate](imtreportcontext_generate.md "Generate") method.
EnIEVersion
Internet Explorer minimum version is indicated using EnIEVersion for correct display of HTML reports.
| ID | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IE_VERSION_ANY | 0x0000 | Any Internet Explorer version is supported. |
| IE_VERSION_9 | 0x0900 | Internet Explorer version should be no older than 9. |
| IE_VERSION_FIRST |  | Beginning of enumeration. Corresponds to IE_VERSION_ANY. |
| IE_VERSION_LAST |  | End of enumeration. Corresponds to IE_VERSION_9. |

Parameters
The structure contains the following parameters:
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| version | UINT | In this parameter, information about the reports module version is passed to the server. |
| version_api | UINT | This field is used to pass the version of the Report API, in which the module has been compiled. |
| version_ie | UINT | The Internet Explorer minimum version is passed in this field for the correct display of reports. To pass the version, the [EnIEVersion](mtreportinfo.htm#enieversion) enumeration is used. |
| name | wchar_t | This parameter is used to pass the name of the module. |
| copyright | wchar_t | This parameter is used to pass the copyright. |
| description | wchar_t | This parameter is used to pass the module description. |
| snapshots | UINT | Databases snapshots flags are passed in this parameter. To pass the options, the [EnSnapshots](mtreportinfo.htm#ensnapshots) enumeration is used. |
| types | UINT | Reports types supported by the module are passed in this parameter. [EnTypes](mtreportinfo.htm#entypes) enumeration is used for passing. |
| category | wchar_t | Report category. It is used for grouping reports in a tree view in the Manager and Administrator terminals. |
| params | MTReportParam | The array of the reports request parameters from this module. The parameters are described by the [MTReportParam](mtreportparam.md "MTReportParam") structure. |
| params_total | UINT | The total number of request parameters. |
| config | MTReportParam | The array of external module parameters that can be changed during the configuration in MetaTrader 5 Administrator. The parameters are described by the [MTReportParam](mtreportparam.md "MTReportParam") structure. |
| config_total | UINT | The total number of external parameters. |
| reserved | UINT | A reserved field for future use. |
