IMTConFeeder::GatewayLogin
Gets a login for the authorization of the history server on the gateway server.
C++
UINT64 IMTConFeeder::GatewayLogin() const

ulong CIMTConFeeder.GatewayLogin()  
---  
Python (Manager API)
MTConFeeder.GatewayLogin  
---  
Return Value
Login for authorization.
Note
Similar to gateways, all data feeds use Gateway API for operation. In order to connect a history server to the gateway server (developed using Gateway API), you need to specify authorization parameters. These parameters are designed for security purposes, as well as for ease of debugging of data feeds for third-party developers. If you do not need debugging, you can specify any login and password, as well as any available network address, through which the interaction of the data feed with the server will be implemented.
