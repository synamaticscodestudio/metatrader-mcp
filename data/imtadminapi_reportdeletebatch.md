config_total
[in] The number of configurations in the 'configs' array.
results
[out] An array with the results of deletion of each configuration on the server.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error code is returned. The [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code is an indication of successful sending of changes to a server; results of applying the changes are passed in the 'results' parameter.
Further Note
Configurations can only be deleted when connected to the main trade server. In all other cases, the [MT_RET_ERR_NOTMAIN](retcodes_api.md "API") response code is returned. If the object is not found, the [MT_RET_ERR_PARAMS](retcodes_common.md "Common errors") error code is added to the 'results' array of this object.
