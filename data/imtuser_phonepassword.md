Get a client's phone password.

---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)

Return Value
If successful, it returns a pointer to a string with the phone password. Otherwise, it returns NULL.
Note
The pointer to the resulting string is valid for the lifetime of the [IMTUser](imtuser.md "IMTUser") object.
To use the string after the object removal (call of the [IMTUser::Release](imtuser_release.md "Release") method of this object), a copy of it should be created.

Note
The phone password length is limited to 64 characters (including the end-of-line character). If a string of a greater length is assigned, it will be cut to this length.
