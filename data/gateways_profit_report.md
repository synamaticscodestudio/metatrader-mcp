Gateways Profit Report
Gateways Profit Report is a report on volumes of the deals handled by gateways, as well as the profit earned by a broker when handling these deals.
Configuration in MetaTrader 5 Manager
The following parameters must be set in the manager terminal before requesting the report:
  * Period — starting and ending date of the period, for which the report will be generated.

Configuration in MetaTrader 5 Administrator
  * Currency — currency used for displaying deals volumes and profit.

The following data on each gateway is displayed in the report:
  * Symbol — symbol, for which turnover and profit are displayed;
  * Deals — number of deals processed by a gateway for this symbol;
  * Lots — deals volume (in lots) processed by a gateway for this symbol;
  * Amount — volume of the deals (in base currency) processed by a gateway for this symbol. Calculation is performed according to the equations:

  * for "Forex" calculation type = Volume (in lots) * Contract Size
  * for "Futures", "Exchange Futures", "FORTS Futures" calculation types = [Price * Volume (in lots) * Tick price] / Tick size
  * for "CFD", "CFD Index", "CFD Leverage" and "Exchange Stocks" calculation types = Price * Volume (in lots) * Contract Size;
  * Currency — symbol base currency;
  * Amount Rate — conversion rate of a base currency to the currency used for parameters display (specified in report settings in MetaTrader 5 Administrator);
  * Amount, currency — deals volume in the currency used for parameters display (specified in report settings in MetaTrader 5 Administrator);
  * Profit, pips — broker's profit in pips. Calculated by the following equations:

  * for BUY deal = Deal price - gateway price
  * for SELL deal = Gateway price - deal price
  * Profit — broker's profit in symbol profit currency. Calculated by the following equations:

symbols with "Forex", "CFD", "CFD Index", "CFD Leverage" or "Exchange Stocks" calculation types:
  * for BUY deals = [Deal price * Volume (in lots) * Contract Size] - [Gateway price * Volume (in lots) * Contract Size]
  * for SELL deals = [Deal price * Volume (in lots) * Contract Size] - [Gateway price * Volume (in lots) * Contract Size]

symbols with "Futures", "Exchange Futures" and "FORTS Futures" calculation types:
  * for BUY deals ("Futures") = [Deal price - Gateway price] * Volume (in lots) * Tick price
  * for SELL deals ("Futures") = [Gateway price - Deal price] * Volume (in lots) * Tick price
