Equity Report
Equity Report is a report on the financial state of the requested accounts as of the end of a day. The accounts are grouped according to their "Comment" field value. This report allows to generate reports on clients' accounts grouping them by custom criteria.
Setup
The following parameters must be set in the manager terminal before requesting the report:
  * Groups — the groups containing the accounts, on which the report must be created. You can specify one or several accounts separating them by commas;
  * Period — starting and ending date of the period, for which the report will be generated. The report is based on daily reports. Therefore, it cannot be generated for the current day, as daily reports are generated only at the end of a day.

Daily reports generation must be enabled on the server for the appropriate account groups to generate this type of reports.
