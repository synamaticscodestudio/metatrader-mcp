Trade Transactions Report
Trade Transaction Report provides detailed data on trading operations at MetaTrader 5 servers. This report is useful not only for a broker but also when providing data to regulatory bodies.
The report is implemented as TradesTransactionReports.dll file (TradesTransactionReports64.dll for 64-bit platform version) combining the report and the server plugin. The plugin collects data on report transactions and saves them in Reports\Trades.Transaction.Reports directory in trading server's folder, while the report provides collected data in the appropriate format. The plugin should be enabled in the settings of the appropriate trading server. If the plugin is not enabled, report data will not be updated and the report will provide data only for the plugin's operation period.
TradesTransactionReports.dll file is included into the standard delivery and located in Reports directory of MetaTrader 5 trading server.
Plugin Installation
The appropriate plugin should be installed to collect the data used in the report. To install the plugin, enter Plugins section in MetaTrader 5 Administrator. After the server to install the plugin has been selected, click "
The following settings are available:
  * Groups — group filter. Groups are separated with a comma. To specify groups, you may also use the mask "*" and the negation sign "!". For example, the value "demoforex,democfd" means that the plugin will collect the transaction details for users in demoforex and democfd groups. The value "*" is for all groups. The default value is "*,!demo*,!contest*" which means all groups except those whose names start with demo and contest.
  * Base Directory — name of the directory where the database of transactions is saved for the report. The data is saved for each day. This directory is automatically created in Reports\Trade.Transaction.Report. In most cases, this parameter should save a default value. 
  * Symbol — symbol filter. Symbols are separated with a comma. To specify groups, you may also use the mask "*" and the negation sign "!". For example, the value "EURUSD,GBPUSD" means that the plugin will collect the transaction details for EURUSD and GBPUSD symbols. The value "*" is for all symbols. *,!CFD\\* value is for all symbols except those in the CFD group.

It is not recommended to use the same Base Directory parameters for different plugins. In such case, correct operation of those plugins is not guaranteed.

Report Installation
To install the plugin, enter Reports section in MetaTrader 5 Administrator. After the server to install the report has been selected, click "Add" command.
The following specific settings are available for the report:
  * Base Directory — the directory where transaction databases are searched for. This parameter should be similar to the same-name parameter of the corresponding plugin. If the plugin with a similar Base Directory parameter does not exist, the report will be empty. Several reports may refer to the similar transaction databases.
  * Show group owner — the flag of Group Owner column display in the report. On default, the column is displayed (Yes). When set to No, Group Owner is not displayed in the report.
  * Show daily transactions — whether to show the state of orders and positions as of the end of the trading day (the "daily order" and "daily deal" fields) in the report.
  * Show reason — whether to show reasons for the execution of trading operations (the "reason" field) in the report.
  * Show retcode — whether to show codes of operation execution results (the "retcode" field) in the report.
  * Show rejected — showing rejected operation in the report.
  * Daily Report Path, Daily Report Time — once a day, the report plugin unloads data on all transactions for the past day to a CSV file.

  * In the "Daily Report Path" parameter, set the name of the folder in the trade server installation directory, in which files with transactions will be saved. The "confirms" folder is used by default. In this case, files are saved at the following path: [trade server directory]\confirms\\\YYYY.MM.DD.trans\\\"Base Directory".csv, where "Base Directory" is the value of plugin's "Base Directory" parameter.
  * Specify the time, when the file with transactions should be generated, in the "Daily Report Time" parameter. The time is not set by default, so the file is generated at the [end of the trading day](imtconservertrade_overnighttime.md "OvernightTime") (after completion of all day closing procedures).

The standard parameters are described in the ["Report Configuration"](reportapi_configuration.md "Report Configuration") section.
