  * [IMTAdmin::PositionSplit](imtadminapi_positionsplit.md "PositionSplit")
  * [IMTManager::PositionSplit](imtmanagerapi_positionsplit.md "PositionSplit")

If the split operation will cause a position volume to become zero, the split will not be performed, and the MT_RET_TRADE_SPLIT_VOLUME error code will be added to the 'results' return array.
