IMTCustomSink::HookWebAPICommand
A hook of an event of execution of a [Web client's custom command](webapi_protocol_extension.md "Protocol Extension").
MTAPIRES IMTCustomSink::HookWebAPICommand( const UINT64 session, // Session identifier LPCWSTR ip, // IP address of the Web client const IMTConManager* manager, // An object of the manager configuration LPCWSTR command, // A command of the Web client IMTByteStream* indata, // Input data IMTByteStream* outdata, // Output data )  
---  
Parameters
session
[in] A unique ID of Web client connection session. This identifier does not change during the connection session. Each ID is unique for the entire cluster of the platform and is never repeated.
ip
[in] The IP address of the manager who has sent the custom command.
manager
[in] The object of configuration of a manager account using which the Web client connects.
command
[in] A command sent by a Web client.
indata
[in] [The object of the data stream](imtbytestream.md "IMTByteStream") sent to the server.
outdata
[out] A pointer to the [object of the data stream](imtbytestream.md "IMTByteStream") returned in response to the command.
Return Value
If the hook does not handle the event, it returns [MT_RET_OK_NONE](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion"). If the event is handled, the return code is forwarded to the Web client together with the outdata buffer.
Note
The hook is called consistently in accordance with the order of plugins in the list until the first plugin that has returned a response code other than [MT_RET_OK_NONE](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion").
Features of Client Command Processing in Web API
When reading and sending commands through the indata and outdata parameters respectively, it is necessary to consider the format of Web API commands:
| COMMAND | PARAM1=VALUE1 | PARAM2=VALUE2 | \r\n additional_body |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

---  
A command can consist of three elements:
  * A text command of the Web API — in response to a request, the server generates forms this part of the command, which is identical to the received command.
  * Command parameters and their values ​​— each command can have multiple parameters, separated by the character "|". The end of a command is the newline character "\r\n". In response to a request, the server automatically generates one additional parameter: RETCODE=response code returned from a hook.
  * An additional body — this part is used only in commands sent from a server to a client.

The PHP and .NET Web API implementations for sending custom commands feature the [MTWebAPI::CustomSend](php_customsend.md "CustomSend") and [MTWebAPI.CustomSend](net_customsend.md "CustomSend") methods respectively.
The Order of Reading Input Data
To read input data from indata methods, the WebRead* methods of the [IMTByteStream](imtbytestream.md "IMTByteStream") interface are used. Methods should be called in the order that corresponds to the format of Web API commands:
  * Reading a command — the [IMTByteStream::WebReadCommand](imtbytestream_webreadcommand.md "WebReadCommand") method.
  * Reading the parameter name — [IMTByteStream::WebReadParamName](imtbytestream_webreadparamname.md "WebReadParamName").
  * Reading the parameter value — one of the [IMTByteStream::WebReadParam*](imtbytestream_webreadparamstr.md "WebReadParamStr") methods, which corresponds to the value type.
  * Then the name and value of each of the remaining parameters is read one by one using the methods described above. After all parameters are read, in response to the IMTByteStream::WebReadParamName method, the server returns the [MT_RET_ERR _NOTFOUND](retcodes_common.md "Common errors") response code.
  * To read the additional body of commands, common reading methods [IMTByteStream::Read*](imtbytestream_read.md "Read") are used.

When calling the [IMTByteStream::ReadReset](imtbytestream_readreset.md "ReadReset") method, command reading should be started in the order described above.

An Example of Data Reading:
MTAPISTR cmd={0},name={0},myparam1={0}; MTAPISTR retcode; //--- Check if this is our command if(CMTStr::CompareNoCase(command,L"MYCOMMAND")!=0) return(MT_RET_OK_NONE); //--- Necessarily read the command //--- It will match what was passed in command if(indata->WebReadCommand(cmd)!=MT_RET_OK) { //--- Error return(MT_RET_ERR_DATA); } //--- Read parameters while((retcode=indata->WebReadParamName(name))==MT_RET_OK) { //--- Is this MYPARAM1? if(CMTStr::CompareNoCase(name,L"MYPARAM1")==0) { //--- Get the value if(indata->WebReadParamStr(myparam1)!=MT_RET_OK) { //--- Error return(MT_RET_ERR_DATA); } } //--- We don't know other parameters, skip them if(indata->WebReadParamSkip()!=MT_RET_OK) { //--- Error return(MT_RET_ERR_DATA); } } //--- Are parameters over or is there any error? if(retcode!=MT_RET_ERR_NOTFOUND) { //--- Error return(MT_RET_ERR_DATA); }  
---  
The Order of Generation of Output Data
When forming output data (outdata), it should be taken into account that the server automatically generates the necessary part of the response command:
| Received command | RETCODE=Response code of the hook |
| --- | --- |

---  
  * The remaining parameters must be formed by using the [IMTByteStream::WebAddParam*](imtbytestream_webaddparamstr.md "WebAddParamStr") methods.
  * To complete work with parameters, call the [IMTByteStream::WebAddParamFinalize](imtbytestream_webaddparamfinalize.md "WebAddParamFinalize") method. In fact, it adds the line break character \r\n, which means the end of the main body of a command.
  * Next, using the [IMTByteStream::Add*](imtbytestream_add.md "Add") methods you can create an additional body of a command.

An Example of Data Forming:
//--- Add our own output parameter if(outdata->WebAddParamStr(L"MYRESULT",L"HELLO WORLD!!!")!=MT_RET_OK) { //--- Error return(MT_RET_ERROR); } //--- Finalize parameters if(outdata->WebAddParamFinalize()!=MT_RET_OK) { //--- Error return(MT_RET_ERROR); } //--- A structure with our additional parameters MyData data={0}; //--- Add as an additional body if(outdata->Add(&data,sizeof(data))!=MT_RET_OK) { //--- Error return(MT_RET_ERROR); }

Reserved Names of Commands
There are special names reserved for use in the trading platform. These names cannot be used for custom commands:
  * AUTH_*
  * USER_*
  * TRADE_*
  * TIME_*
  * GROUP_*
  * ORDER_*
  * POSITION_*
  * DEAL_*
  * HISTORY_*
  * TICK_*
  * MAIL_*
  * NEWS_*
  * COMMON_*
  * QUIT*
  * TEST_TRADE
  * TEST_ACCESS

When extending the Web API protocol, it is recommended that you use command names that will not intersect with the commands implemented on the side of MetaTrader 5 servers or any other third-party plugins. For example, you can use the company name in the command name: MYCOMPANY_MYCOMMAND.
