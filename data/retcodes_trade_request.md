| MT_RET_REQUEST_CLOSE_ORDER_EXIST | 10039 | Order to close the position already exists. The error may appear in the hedging mode: |

  * when trying to closed a position with an opposite one in case there's already an order to close that position
  * when trying to close the entire position or a part of it in case the total volume of existing orders to close it and the newly placed order exceeds the current volume of the position

  
MT_RET_REQUEST_LIMIT_POSITIONS | 10040 | The number of open positions simultaneously present on an account can be limited by the settings of a group. After a limit is reached, the server returns the MT_TRADE_RETCODE_REQUEST_LIMIT_POSITIONS error when attempting to place an order. The limitation operates differently depending on the position accounting type:
  * Netting � number of open positions is considered. When a limit is reached, the platform disables placing new orders whose execution may increase the number of open positions. In fact, the platform allows placing orders only for the symbols that already have open positions. The current pending orders are not considered since their execution may lead to changes in the current positions but it cannot increase their number.
  * Hedging � pending orders are considered together with open positions, since a pending order activation always leads to opening a new position. When a limit is reached, the platform disables placing both new market orders for opening positions and pending orders.

  
MT_RET_REQUEST_REJECT_CANCEL | 10041 | Request rejected, order canceled. This code is returned when the action [IMTConRoute::ACTION_CANCEL_ORDER](imtconroute_enum.htm#enrouteaction) in a routing rule is applied.  
MT_RET_REQUEST_LONG_ONLY | 10042 | The request is rejected, because the "Only long positions are allowed" rule is set for the symbol ([IMTConSymbol::TRADE_LONGONLY](imtconsymbol_enum.htm#entrademode)).  
MT_RET_REQUEST_SHORT_ONLY | 10043 | The request is rejected, because the "Only short positions are allowed" rule is set for the symbol ([IMTConSymbol::TRADE_SHORTONLY](imtconsymbol_enum.htm#entrademode)).  
MT_RET_REQUEST_CLOSE_ONLY | 10044 | The request is rejected, because the "Only position closing is allowed" rule is set for the symbol ([IMTConSymbol::TRADE_CLOSEONLY](imtconsymbol_enum.htm#entrademode)).  
MT_RET_REQUEST_PROHIBITED_BY_FIFO | 10045 | Position closure is not allowed by the FIFO rule. It is used for the groups with the enabled [IMTConGroup::TRADEFLAGS_FIFO_CLOSE](imtcongroup_enum.htm#entradeflags) option, according to which all positions should be closed strictly in the order in which they were opened: the oldest one should be closed first, then the next one, etc.  
MT_RET_REQUEST_HEDGE_PROHIBITED | 10046 | Opening of a position or placing of a pending order is not possible because hedge positions are prohibited. The error is returned if a user tries to execute a trading operation in the case the [IMTConGroup::TRADEFLAGS_HEDGE_PROHIBIT](imtcongroup_enum.htm#entradeflags) flag is enabled for the group and the user already has an opposite order or position for the same symbol.
