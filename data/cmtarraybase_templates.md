Templates
In addition to the base class for working with arrays, the MT5APIStorage.h class contains the description of the additional class [TMTArray](cmtarraybase_templates.md "Templates"), which allows to work with typed data arrays. Methods similar to [CMTArrayBase](cmtarraybase.md "CMTArrayBase") methods are used for working with such arrays.
To start using the methods for working with arrays, declare an array object through a template:
TMTArray<T,step> arr;  
---  
Two parameters are specified for the array:
  * T — the type of data that will be stored in the array.
  * step — the array change step for reallocation of memory for the array. The step is specified as a number of elements.

Then you can work with the array using the methods similar to the methods of class [CMTArrayBase](cmtarraybase.md "CMTArrayBase") by calling them as methods of the TMTArray class. For example, a method similar to [CMTArrayBase::Add](cmtarraybase_add.md "Add") will be used as follows:
bool TMTArray::Add( const T *elem // An element to be added )  
---  
The type of data earlier set for the array will be used as the type of the element to add.
