Otherwise expert to Oracle databases will not be possible.

Run the installation file and follow the on-screen instructions. Choose an installation directory an a set of components:
Next, select the directory, in which the databases will be stored, set a password for the administrator account "postgres". Then specify the port at which the PostgreSQL server will listen to incoming connections.
Next, set the [locale](locale.md) to be used by by the database cluster. The locale is inherited from the operating system be default. Locale affects the operation of some SQL requests. In the next steps, click "Next", and wait for the installation to complete.
