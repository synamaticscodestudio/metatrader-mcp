Daily Detailed Report
Daily Detailed Report is a detailed report on the financial state of the one selected account as of the end of a day.
Setup
The following parameters must be set in the manager terminal before requesting the report:
  * Groups — number of the account, for which the report must be generated;
  * Period — a day, for which the report must be generated. Since the daily data, based on which the report is created, is only generated at the end of the trading day, a current day report cannot be requested.

  * Daily data generation should be enabled for the client or group for which the request is created. Otherwise, the report on them will not be available.
  * If the report for the selected day is not available for some reason (for example, daily data generation was disabled on the server), the system will try to show the next available report.

The report is divided into several blocks.
Header
The following data is specified here:
  * The name of a brokerage company;
  * Account number;
  * Name of the account owner;
  * Deposit currency;
  * Report generation date.

Orders
This block contains the table displaying the [orders](imtorder.md "IMTOrder") set during the specified day.

The [deals](imtdeal.md "IMTDeal") performed during the selected day are displayed here. Additional parameters are displayed at the bottom of the orders block:
  * Closed P/L — total closed profit/loss at all deals per day.
  * Deposit/Withdrawal — total funds deposited/withdrawn from the account per day; 
  * Credit Facility — credit funds deposited/withdrawn from the account per day;
  * Round Commission — commission by orders and positions accumulated during a day/month. Depending on the settings (specified for the group in the administrator terminal), preliminary commission calculation is performed during a day/month and the appropriate funds are blocked in the account and displayed here. Final commission calculation is performed at the end of a day/month and the appropriate sum is withdrawn from the account by the balance operation. In case commission is charged immediately during a deal, its value is shown in the "Commission" field.
  * Additional Operations — financial result of other transactions performed in the account. These are additional charges, corrections, bonuses, agent commissions and annual interests;
  * Total — total sum for the above operations.

The final parameters are derived from the data stored in [daily databases](imtdaily.md "\\IMTDaily"). The deal history is requested from the corresponding database on the trading server.
