Segregated Report
Segregated Report is a report on the change of financial state of the requested accounts for the specified period. The report is generated on the basis of daily reports. Thus each rate is calculated as the difference between its value in the daily report for the last date and the value in the daily report for the first date specified when requesting the report. Summarized data of the accounts (for example, balance, equity and floating p/l) is taken from the daily reports generated for the last date within the time range the report is requested for. If there is no report generated for that date, zero values will be displayed.
Setup
The following parameters must be set in the manager terminal before requesting the report:
  * Groups — the groups containing the accounts, on which the report must be created. You can specify one or several accounts separating them by commas;
  * Period — starting and ending date of the period, for which the report will be generated.

Daily reports generation must be enabled on the server for the appropriate account groups to generate this type of reports.

The report contains the following data:
  * Login — account number.
  * Name — account holder name.

  * Group — group the account belongs to.

  * Country — client's country of residence.
  * Account comment — comment to the trading account.

  * Deposit — total funds deposited/withdrawn from the account per day.
  * Credit — final amount of credit funds submitted for the selected period (the difference between provided and withdrawn funds).
  * Commission — commission in the account for the specified period. Both blocked commission (in case they are accumulated within a day/a month and then withdrawn in a single balance deal), and commission charged immediately during a transaction are considered here.
  * Swap — total amount of swaps accumulated during the selected period. The amount is calculated based on swap values in deals.
  * Profit — net profit (profit - loss) obtained for the selected period.
  * Interest — annual interest accrued for the selected period.
  * Balance — balance at the moment of generation of the daily report for the last date within the time range the report is requested for.
  * Floating P/L — floating profit/loss in the account at the moment of generation of the daily report for the last date within the time range the report is requested for.
  * Equity — amount of funds in the account at the moment of generation of the daily report for the last date within the time range the report is requested for.
  * Currency — account deposit currency.
