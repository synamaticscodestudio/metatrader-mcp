CMTStr::Compare
Compare a string object with the specified string.
int CMTStr::Compare( LPCWSTR str // String ) const  
---  
Parameters
str
[in] The string, with which you compare the current string object.
Return Value
If the strings are equal, it returns 0. A value < 0 means that the string object is less than str, a value > 0 means that it's greater than str.
Note
The comparison is case sensitive.
CMTStr::Compare
Compare a string object with the specified string till the specified character.
int CMTStr::Compare( LPCWSTR str, // String UINT count // The number of the character ) const  
---  
Parameters
str
[in] The string, with which you compare the current string object.
count
[in] The number of the character, to which the strings are compared. Numbering starts from 0.
Return Value
If the strings are equal, it returns 0. A value < 0 means that the string object is less than str, a value > 0 means that it's greater than str.
Note
Compares a string with the specified one, but to the character specified in the count parameter.
The comparison is case sensitive.
CMTStr::Compare
Compare a string object with the specified string object.
int CMTStr::Compare( const CMTStr& str // String object ) const  
---  
Parameters
str
[in] The [CMTStr](cmtstr.md "CMTStr") string object, with which you compare the current string object.
Return Value
If the objects are equal, it returns 0. A value < 0 means that the current string object is less than str, a value > 0 means that it's greater than str.
Note
The comparison is case sensitive.
CMTStr::Compare
Compare two strings.
static int CMTStr::Compare( LPCWSTR str1, // A string to compare LPCWSTR str2 // A string to compare )  
---  
Parameters
str1
[in] A string to compare.
str2
[in] A string to compare.
Return Value
If the strings are equal, it returns 0. A value < 0 means that the string str1 is less than str2, a value > 0 means that str1 is greater than str2.
Note
The comparison is case sensitive.
CMTStr::Compare
Compare two strings till the specified character.
static int CMTStr::Compare( LPCWSTR str1, // A string to compare LPCWSTR str2, // A string to compare UINT count // The number of the character )  
---  
Parameters
str1
[in] A string to compare.
str2
[in] A string to compare.
count
[in] The number of the character, to which the strings are compared. Numbering starts from 0.
Return Value
If the strings are equal, it returns 0. A value < 0 means that the string str1 is less than str2, a value > 0 means that str1 is greater than str2.
Note
The function compares two strings, but to the character specified in the count parameter.
The comparison is case sensitive.
