IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimitExt
Gets the maximum aggregate volume (with extended accuracy) of positions and orders for a symbol for this group.
C++
UINT64 IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimitExt() const  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
ulong CIMTConGroupSymbol.VolumeLimitExt()  
---  
Python (Manager API)
MTConGroupSymbol.VolumeLimitExt  
---  
Return Value
The maximum allowed aggregate volume of positions and orders in one direction for a symbol for this group. The volume is specified in the UINT64 format (one unit corresponds to 1/100000000 lot, for example, 105000000 means 1.05 lots).
Note
For example: if the limit is 5 lots, you may have an open position of 5 lots and place a Sell Limit order of 5 lots as well. But in this case you cannot place a pending Buy Limit order (since the total volume in one direction will exceed the limit) or place a Sell Limit order above 5 lots.
The method operates with [the extended volume accuracy](features.htm#volume) (8 decimal places). For standard volume accuracy, use the [IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimit](imtcongroupsymbol_volumelimit.md "VolumeLimit") method.
IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimitExt

Program Parameters
volume
[in] The maximum allowed aggregate volume of positions and orders in one direction for a symbol for this group. The volume is specified in the UINT64 format (one unit corresponds to 1/100000000 lot, for example, 105000000 means 1.05 lots).
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred, which corresponds to the response code.
Note
For example: if the limit is 5 lots, you may have an open position of 5 lots and place a Sell Limit order of 5 lots as well. But in this case you cannot place a pending Buy Limit order (since the total volume in one direction will exceed the limit) or place a Sell Limit order above 5 lots.
The method operates with [the extended volume accuracy](features.htm#volume) (8 decimal places). For standard volume accuracy, use the [IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimit](imtcongroupsymbol_volumelimit.md "VolumeLimit") method.
