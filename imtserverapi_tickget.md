IMTServerAPI::TickGet
Get accepted quotes for a symbol in the specified time range.
MTAPIRES IMTServerAPI::TickGet( LPCWSTR symbol, // Symbol const INT64 from, // Start date const INT64 to, // End date MTTickShort*& ticks, // A pointer to the array of structures of quotes UINT& ticks_total // Number of quotes )  
---  
Parameters
symbol
[in] The name of the symbol, for which you need to get quotes.
from
[in] The start date for requesting quotes. The date is specified in seconds since January 1, 1970. If the parameter is set to 0, the date of the first available quote is used.
to
[in] The end date for requesting quotes. The date is specified in seconds since January 1, 1970. If the parameter is set to 0, the date of the last available quote is used.
ticks
[out] A pointer to the array of structures that describe quotes ([MTTickShort](mttickshort.md "MTTickShort")).
ticks_total
[out] The total number of received quotes.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred that corresponds to the response code.
Note
This method returns only accepted quotes (but not processed in accordance with the symbol settings of the group).
When using the method on a trade server, it returns a buffer with last accepted quotes (up to 128 last quotes for each symbol).
When using the method on a history server it returns all accepted quotes in the specified time range.
After being used, the array of structures [MTTickShort](mttickshort.md "MTTickShort") must be released using the [IMTServerAPI::Free](imtserverapi_free.md "Free") method.
