IMTUser::Phone
Get a client's phone number.
C++
LPCWSTR IMTUser::Phone() const  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
string CIMTUser.Phone()  
---  
Return Value
If successful, it returns a pointer to the string with the phone number. Otherwise, it returns NULL.
Note
The pointer to the resulting string is valid for the lifetime of the [IMTUser](imtuser.md "IMTUser") object.
To use the string after the object removal (call of the [IMTUser::Release](imtuser_release.md "Release") method of this object), a copy of it should be created.
IMTUser::Phone
Set a client's phone number.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTUser::Phone( LPCWSTR phone // Phone )  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTUser.Phone( string phone // Phone )  
---  
Parameters
phone
[in] Client's phone number.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred that corresponds to the response code.
Note
The phone number length is limited to 32 characters (including the end-of-line character). If a string of a greater length is assigned, it will be cut to this length.
