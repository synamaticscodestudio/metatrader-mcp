This structure is used in the following methods:
  * [IMTManagerAPI::TickAddStat](imtmanagerapi_tickaddstat.md "TickAddStat")
  * [IMTManagerAPI::TickStat](imtmanagerapi_tickstat.md "TickStat")
  * [IMTTickSink::OnTickStat](imtticksink_ontickstat.md "OnTickStat")
  * [IMTTickSink::HookTickStat](imtticksink_hooktickstat.md "HookTickStat")
  * [IMTGatewayAPI::SendTickStats](imtgatewayapi_sendtickstats.md "SendTickStats")
  * [IMTServerAPI::TickAddStat](imtserverapi_tickaddstat.md "TickAddStat")
  * [IMTServerAPI::TickStat](imtserverapi_tickstat.md "TickStat")

The structure contains the following parameters:
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| news | wchar_t | Symbol name. |
| datetime | INT64 | Date and time of the tick in seconds passed since 01.01.1970. This fields is not filled in by default (equal to 0) - the history server inserts the server's current trading time when receiving the data. If necessary, the gateway developer can set this date on their own. Using this feature implies 100% correctness of the transferred data time. Therefore, it should be used only when necessary. |

  * datetime_msc has a higher priority than datetime. The server will use this value if it it specified.
  * If datetime_msc is specified only, datetime value will be filled automatically on its basis (without milliseconds).
  * If datetime is specified only, datetime_msc value will be filled automatically on its basis (with zero value for milliseconds).

If you specify the time yourself, consider the time zone of the trade server ([IMTConTime::TimeZone](imtcontime_timezone.md "TimeZone")). For example, if the data feed passes the UNIX time (GMT 0), while the trading server works in GMT+2 time zone, the value should be increased by 60*60*2 (2 hours in seconds).

trade_sell_volume | UINT64 | The total volume of buy sell requests. When specifying a value pay attention to [the peculiarities of working with volume](mttickstat.htm#volume). For operations with [extended volume accuracy](features.htm#volume), use the trade_sell_volume_ext field.  
trade_volume_ext | UINT64 | The total volume of deals within a session, with [extended accuracy](features.htm#volume). It is similar to the 'trade_volume' field, but the value is passed with the fixed number of decimal places (8). The 'trade_volume_ext' value has a higher priority than 'trade_volume'.  
trade_buy_volume_ext | UINT64 | The total volume of buy requests with [extended accuracy](features.htm#volume). It is similar to the 'trade_buy_volume' field, but the value is passed with the fixed number of decimal places (8). The 'trade_buy_volume_ext' value has a higher priority than 'trade_buy_volume'.  
trade_sell_volume_ext | UINT64 | The total volume of sell requests with [extended accuracy](features.htm#volume). It is similar to the 'trade_sell_volume' field, but the value is passed with the fixed number of decimal places (8). The 'trade_sell_volume_ext' value has a higher priority than 'trade_sell_volume'.  
vol_high_ext | UINT64 | The maximum deal volume doe a day, with [extended accuracy](features.htm#volume). It is similar to the 'vol_high' field, but the value is passed with the fixed number of decimal places (8). The 'vol_high_ext' value has a higher priority than 'vol_high'.  
vol_low_ext | UINT64 | The minimum deal volume doe a day, with [extended accuracy](features.htm#volume). It is similar to the 'vol_low' field, but the value is passed with the fixed number of decimal places (8). The 'vol_low_ext' value has a higher priority than 'vol_low'.

datetime_msc | INT64 | Date and time of the tick in milliseconds passed since 01.01.1970. This fields is not filled in by default (equal to 0) - the history server inserts the server's current trading time when receiving the data. If necessary, the gateway developer can set this date on their own. Using this feature implies 100% correctness of the transferred data time. Therefore, it should be used only when necessary.
  * datetime_msc has a higher priority than datetime. The server will use this value if it it specified.
  * If datetime_msc is specified only, datetime value will be filled automatically on its basis (without milliseconds).
  * If datetime is specified only, datetime_msc value will be filled automatically on its basis (with zero value for milliseconds).

If you specify the time yourself, consider the time zone of the trade server ([IMTConTime::TimeZone](imtcontime_timezone.md "TimeZone")). For example, if the data feed passes the UNIX time (GMT 0), while the trading server works in GMT+2 time zone, the value should be increased by 60*60*1000*2 (2 hours in milliseconds).

price_theoretical | double | The theoretical (fair) price of an option calculated for the specified strike based on historical data.  
price_greeks_delta | double | Option delta. "[The Greeks](https://www.metatrader5.com/ru/terminal/help/trading/options_board#greeks)", which include Delta, Theta, Gamma, Vega, Po and Omega, are quantities representing the sensitivity of the option price to changes in various parameters: strike prices, volatility, etc.

price_sensitivity | double | Option sensitivity. It shows by how many points the price of the option's underlying asset should change so that the price of the option changes by one point.  
price_reserved | int | A reserved field for future use.  
Peculiarities of working with volume
Volume (for example, in the parameters like trade_sell_volume, trade_buy_volume etc.) is recorded in the same form as it is passed by a data provider. A data provider may pass volumes as amounts of contracts (in lots) or as amounts of money. On the trading platform side, this value is interpreted depending on the type of calculation of profit and margin set for a symbol ([IMTConSymbol::CalcMode](imtconsymbol_calcmode.md "CalcMode")):
  * For the [IMTConSymbol::TRADE_MODE_FOREX](imtconsymbol_enum.htm#encalcmode) type, the volumes are interpreted as amounts of money.
  * For all the other type, the volumes are interpreted as amounts of contracts (lots).

Notes on extended volume accuracy operations:
  * The *_volume_ext value always has a higher priority than *_volume. The server will use this value if specified.
  * If only the '*_volume_ext' value is specified, the '*_volume' field will be filled automatically based on the extended accuracy value (without milliseconds).
  * If only '*_volume' is specified, the '*_volume_ext' field will be filled automatically on the bases of the standard accuracy value (with zero milliseconds).
