Fast Profit Deals
This report is designed to detect traders exploiting arbitrage opportunities through quote delays. Due to various technical limitations, such as delays on the data provider side and network constraints, there may be slight variations in the speed at which quotes are received on brokerage servers. Quotes from one server may react to important news slightly faster than those from another. Traders may attempt to exploit this difference by finding a faster source, observing price movement, and quickly opening a trade in a favorable direction. This effect can be particularly significant during important economic news releases, when prices may move substantially in a short timeframe.
Typically, traders in such scenarios follow a certain pattern: upon the news release, they execute a short-term trade lasting no more than a minute, aiming to capture profit within a few spreads.
The 'Fast Profit Deals' report will assist in detecting such behavior. It shows all deals with a profit higher than the specified profit value and a duration shorter than the specified duration value. Specify the desired parameters in the report settings:
Duration is calculated in seconds between consecutive entry and exit deals based on the nearest previous entry preceding the closing deal within the same position. Profit is defined as the average amount in USD per position lot. This setup also allows determining those traders who accumulate large volumes/sums through small trades.
Additionally, information in the report can be filtered by the following parameters:
  * Profitable trades, spreads — profit form the deals in the number of spreads of the corresponding instrument.
  * Total daily profit — total profit on the trader's account for the selected day.
  * Groups — account groups for which the report is generated. You can specify one or several accounts separating them by commas.
  * Period — report day. A pair of deals is only included in the report only if both the entry and exit deals fall on the specified day.

Profit Graph
The graph displays the profit for all deals included in the report, broken down by hour. It will allow you to trace the connection of suspicious deals with any events. Data can be analyzed from three perspectives: by symbol, group and country.
