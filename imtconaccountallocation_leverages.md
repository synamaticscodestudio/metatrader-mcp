C++
LPCWSTR IMTConAccountAllocation::Leverages() const

string CIMTConAccountAllocation.Leverages()  
---  
Return Value
On success, the method returns a pointer to a string containing a comma-separated list of leverage options. For example: 100,50,30. Otherwise, NULL is returned.
Note
The pointer to the resulting string is valid for the lifetime of the [IMTConAccountAllocation](imtconaccountallocation.md "IMTConAccountAllocation") object.
To use the string after the object removal (after the call of the [IMTConAccountAllocation::Release](imtconaccountallocation_release.md "Release") method of this object), you should create the string copy.
