Delete a substring of the specified length from a string object, starting at the specified position (character).
void CMTStr::Delete( UINT pos, // Position UINT len // Number of characters )  
---  
Parameters
pos
[in] The position starting from which the specified number of characters should be deleted. Numbering starts from 0.
len
[in] The number of characters to delete.
CMTStr::Delete
Delete a substring of the specified length from the specified string, starting at the specified position (character).
static void CMTStr::Delete( wchar_t (&dst)[dstsize], // String UINT pos, // Position UINT len // Number of characters )  
---  
Parameters
(&dst)[dstsize]
[in][out] The string, from which you want to delete a substring (a pointer to the dst buffer of the dstsize size).
pos
[in] The position starting from which the specified number of characters should be deleted. Numbering starts from 0.
len
[in] The number of characters to delete.
Note
To use this method, the compiler must know the size of the string buffer.
