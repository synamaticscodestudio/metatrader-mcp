Trade Accounts Report
Trade Accounts Report — a report on the current trading state of client accounts.
Configuration in MetaTrader 5 Manager
The following parameters must be set in the manager terminal before requesting the report:
  * Groups — the groups containing the accounts, on which the report must be created. You can specify one or several accounts separating them by commas.

Report Data
The report is divided into four units that provide information on modified open orders, history orders, deals and positions:
  * Login — client account number.
  * Name — account holder's name.

  * Group — group the account belongs to.

  * Country — client's country of residence.
  * Account comment — comment to the trading account.

  * Balance — the current account balance.
  * Credit — credit funds on the account.
  * Equity — current account equity.
  * Margin — margin required to maintain open positions on the account.
  * Free Margin — the amount of free margin on the account.
  * Margin Level — the margin level on the account. It corresponds to the account equity or equity percentage to the margin volume (Equity / Margin * 100) depending on the group settings on the server.
  * Blocked Comm. — commission by orders and positions accumulated during a day/month. Depending on the settings, preliminary commission calculation is performed during a day/month and the appropriate amount of money is blocked in the account and displayed here. The final commission calculation is performed at the end of a day/month and the appropriate sum is withdrawn from the account in a balance operation (a separate deal of the 'Daily/Monthly commission' type), and the blocked amount is unblocked.
  * Blocked Profit — if a client group is configured to only include daily loss into free margin calculation, the amount of profit received by a client during a trading day will be recorded in a separate field 'Blocked Profit'. At the end of the trading day, the accumulated profits is released (reset) and is reflected on the user's balance (included into free margin calculation).
  * Profit — profit on the account.
  * Swap — the value of swaps on current client positions.
  * Floating P/L — amount of current floating profit or loss.
  * Currency — client's deposit currency.
