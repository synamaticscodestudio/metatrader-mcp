Gateways Turnover Report
Gateways Turnover Report is a report on volumes of the deals handled by gateways.
Configuration in MetaTrader 5 Manager
The following parameters must be set in the manager terminal before requesting the report:
  * Period — starting and ending date of the period, for which the report will be generated.

Configuration in MetaTrader 5 Administrator
  * Currency — currency used for displaying deals volumes processed by a gateway.

The following data on each gateway is displayed in the report:
  * Symbol — symbol, for which turnover is displayed;
  * Deals — number of deals processed by a gateway for this symbol;
  * Lots — deals volume (in lots) processed by a gateway for this symbol;
  * Amount — volume of the deals (in base currency) processed by a gateway for this symbol. Calculation is performed according to the equations:

  * for "Forex" calculation type = Volume (in lots) * Contract Size
  * for "Futures", "Exchange Futures", "FORTS Futures" calculation types = [Price * Volume (in lots) * Tick price] / Tick size
  * for "CFD", "CFD Index", "CFD Leverage" and "Exchange Stocks" calculation types = Price * Volume (in lots) * Contract Size;
  * Currency — symbol base currency;
  * Amount Rate — conversion rate of a base currency to the currency used for parameters display (specified in report settings in MetaTrader 5 Administrator);
  * Amount, currency — deals volume in the currency used for parameters display (specified in report settings in MetaTrader 5 Administrator).

Volume in the parameters display currency (Amount, currency) is calculated considering exchange rates as of the moment of a report generation and does not reflect an accurate volume at the time of actual deals.
