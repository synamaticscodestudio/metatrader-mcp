IMTConSymbol::VolumeLimit
Gets the maximum aggregate volume of positions and orders for a symbol in one direction.
C++
UINT64 IMTConSymbol::VolumeLimit() const  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
ulong CIMTConSymbol.VolumeLimit()  
---  
Python (Manager API)
MTConSymbol.VolumeLimit  
---  
Return Value
The maximum allowed aggregate volume of positions and orders for a symbol in one direction. Volume is specified in the UINT64 format (one unit corresponds to 1/10000 lot, for example, 10500 means 1.05 lots).
Note
Example: if the limit is 5 lots, you may have an open position of 5 lots and place a Sell Limit order of 5 lots as well. But in this case, you cannot place a pending Buy Limit order (since the total volume in one direction will exceed the limit) or place a Sell Limit order above 5 lots.
The method operates with [the standard volume accuracy](features.htm#volume) (4 decimal places). For extended volume accuracy, use the [IMTConSymbol::VolumeLimitExt](imtconsymbol_volumelimitext.md "VolumeLimitExt") method.
IMTConSymbol::VolumeLimit
Sets the maximum aggregate volume of positions and orders for a symbol in one direction.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTConSymbol::VolumeLimit( const UINT64 volume // Maximum aggregate volume )

.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTConSymbol.VolumeLimit( luong volume // Maximum aggregate volume )  
---  
Python (Manager API)
MTConSymbol.VolumeLimit

Parameters
volume
[in] The maximum allowed aggregate volume of positions and orders for a symbol in one direction. Volume is specified in the UINT64 format (one unit corresponds to 1/10000 lot, for example, 10500 means 1.05 lots).
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred, which corresponds to the response code.
Note
Example: if the limit is 5 lots, you may have an open position of 5 lots and place a Sell Limit order of 5 lots as well. But in this case, you cannot place a pending Buy Limit order (since the total volume in one direction will exceed the limit) or place a Sell Limit order above 5 lots.
The method operates with [the standard volume accuracy](features.htm#volume) (4 decimal places). For extended volume accuracy, use the [IMTConSymbol::VolumeLimitExt](imtconsymbol_volumelimitext.md "VolumeLimitExt") method.
