Gets the order placing time in milliseconds.
C++
INT64 IMTOrder::TimeSetupMsc() const  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
long CIMTOrder.TimeSetupMsc()  
---  
Python
MTOrder.TimeSetupMsc  
---  
Return Value
Date and time when the order is placed, in milliseconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970.
Note
If the order is processed in an external trading system, this property contains the time of order placing in the external system (not in the MetaTrader 5 platform). When Stop Limit orders are triggered, a new value is written to this field, instead of the time the order was placed by the client: the time when the corresponding limit order was placed.
IMTOrder::TimeSetupMsc
Sets the order placing time in milliseconds.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTOrder::TimeSetupMsc( const INT64 time // Expiration time )  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTOrder.TimeSetupMsc( long time // Expiration time )  
---  
Python
MTOrder.TimeSetupMsc

Parameters
time
[in] Date and time when the order is placed, in milliseconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred, which corresponds to the response code.
Note
If the value of this field is specified, the [IMTOrder::TimeSetup](imtorder_timesetup.md "TimeSetup") value will be filled in automatically.
