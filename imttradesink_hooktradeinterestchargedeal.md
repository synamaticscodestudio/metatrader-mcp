IMTTradeSink::HookTradeInterestChargeDeal
A hook of a balance deal for charging annual interest. A hook is called immediately prior to a balance operation.
virtual MTAPIRES IMTTradeSink::HookTradeInterestChargeDeal( const INT64 datetime, // time of interest adding const IMTConGroup* group, // pointer to the group object const IMTUser* user, // pointer to the user object IMTDeal* deal // pointer to the deal object )  
---  
Parameters
datetime
[in] The time of interest charging in seconds that have elapsed since 01.01.1970.
group
[in] A pointer to the object of the [configuration of the group](config_group.md "Groups") of a client, for whom the interest is added.
user
[in] A pointer to the [object of the client record](imtuser.md "IMTUser"), for which the interest is added.
deal
[in/out] A pointer to the [object of the deal](imtdeal.md "IMTDeal") used to charge the annual interest.
Return Value
In case of confirmation, [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") should be returned, otherwise, the request will be rejected with a response code returned from the hook. Thus, if the response code is different from MT_RET_OK, the interest is not added.
Note
The hook is called after [IMTTradeSink::HookTradeInterestCharge](imttradesink_hooktradeinterestcharge.md "HookTradeInterestCharge"). Unlike the latter, it allows modifying different parameters of the deal executed on a client account in addition to a charged amount. For example, it allows you to set custom comments to annual interest charging deals ([IMTDeal::Comment](imtdeal_comment.md "Comment")).
If the obtained response is different from MT_RET_OK, no annual interest is charged (even if it is confirmed in the IMTTradeSink::HookTradeInterestCharge hook). The sum of accumulated interest in the client record ([IMTUser::InterestRate](imtuser_interestrate.md "InterestRate")) is not reset to zero and accumulation is resumed.
