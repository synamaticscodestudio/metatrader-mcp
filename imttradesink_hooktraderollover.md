IMTTradeSink::HookTradeRollover
A hook of rollover charging.
virtual MTAPIRES IMTTradeSink::HookTradeRollover( const INT64 datetime, // Time of charging const IMTConGroup* group, // A pointer to the group object const IMTConSymbol* symbol, // A pointer to the object of the symbol configuration const IMTPosition* position, // A pointer to the position object const double original_value, // Initial value double& new_value // Modified value )  
---  
Parameters
datetime
[in] The time of rollover charging in seconds that have elapsed since 01.01.1970.
group
[in] A pointer to the object of the [configuration of the group](config_group.md "Groups"), for which rollover is charged.
symbol
[in] A pointer to the object of the [configuration of a symbol](config_symbol.md "Symbols"), for which rollover is charged.
position
[in] A pointer to the object of a [trade position](imtposition.md "IMTPosition"), which corresponds to the group and financial instrument, for which rollover is charged.
original_value
[in] The initial rollover value calculated by the server.
new_value
[in][out] The new value of the rollover.
Return Value
In case of confirmation [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") should be returned, otherwise, the request will be rejected with a response code returned from the hook. Thus, if the response code is different from MT_RET_OK, the rollover is not charged.
Note
Initially, the values of original_value and new_value are equal. If the values are different, then the rollover value has been changed (new_value) by one of the previous [hook handlers](serverapi_hooks.md "Hooks").
