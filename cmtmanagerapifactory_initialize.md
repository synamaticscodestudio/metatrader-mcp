Parameters
dll_path
[in] Full path to DLL library of the Manager API. An optional parameter. If the path is not specified, the method will try to find a library in the following order:
  * In the directory where the application executable is located.
  * In the parent directory, then in the next upper-level directory and so on, up to five levels up from the executable files directory.
  * Using the path from the system PATH variable.

Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, a corresponding error code will be returned.
Note
The method loads the DLL of the Manager API and gets addresses of [exported functions](managerapi_exported.md "Exported Functions"). Depending on the application architecture, the 32-bit or 64-bit version of DLL is loaded.
