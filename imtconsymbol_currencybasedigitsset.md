IMTConSymbol::CurrencyBaseDigitsSet
Set the accuracy of conversion into the base currency.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTConSymbol::CurrencyBaseDigitsSet( const UINT digits // Accuracy )  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTConSymbol.CurrencyBaseDigitsSet( uint digits // Accuracy )  
---  
Python (Manager API)
MTConSymbol.CurrencyBaseDigits  
---  
Parameters
digits
[in] The number of decimal places in the rate of conversion to the base currency.
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error code is returned.
Note
For standard world currencies, such as USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF, RUR, etc., the number of digits is set by the platform and cannot be modified. The accuracy of cryptocurrencies (and other non-standard currencies) can be changed manually. A higher accuracy enables a proper calculation of profit and margin through cross-rates, in which such currencies are used. If the accuracy is small, the resulting profit or margin value can be equal to zero due to rounding.
Use the [IMTConSymbol::CurrencyBaseDigits](imtconsymbol_currencybasedigits.md "CurrencyBaseDigits") method to obtain information about the accuracy.
