IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimit
Gets the maximum allowable aggregate volume of positions and orders on a symbol in one direction for this group.
C++
UINT64 IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimit() const  
---  
.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
ulong CIMTConGroupSymbol.VolumeLimit()  
---  
Python (Manager API)
MTConGroupSymbol.VolumeLimit  
---  
Return Value
The maximum allowable aggregate volume of positions and orders on a symbol in one direction for this group. The volume is specified in the UINT64 format (one unit corresponds to 1/10000 lot, for example, 10500 means 1.05 lots).
Note
Example: if the limit is 5 lots, you may have an open position of 5 lots and place a Sell Limit order of 5 lots as well. But in this case, you cannot place a pending Buy Limit order (since the total volume in one direction will exceed the limit) or place a Sell Limit order above 5 lots.
The method operates with [the standard volume accuracy](features.htm#volume) (4 decimal places). For extended volume accuracy, use the [IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimitExt](imtcongroupsymbol_volumelimitext.md "VolumeLimitExt") method.
IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimit
Sets the maximum allowable aggregate volume of positions and orders on a symbol in one direction for this group.
C++
MTAPIRES IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimit( const UINT64 volume // Volume limit )

.NET (Gateway/Manager API)
MTRetCode CIMTConGroupSymbol.VolumeLimit( ulong volume // Volume limit )

Python (Manager API)

Parameters
volume
[in] The maximum allowable aggregate volume of positions and orders on a symbol in one direction for this group. The volume is specified in the UINT64 format (one unit corresponds to 1/10000 lot, for example, 10500 means 1.05 lots).
Return Value
An indication of successful completion is the [MT_RET_OK](retcodes_successful.md "Successful completion") response code. Otherwise, an error has occurred, which corresponds to the response code.
Note
Example: if the limit is 5 lots, you may have an open position of 5 lots and place a Sell Limit order of 5 lots as well. But in this case, you cannot place a pending Buy Limit order (since the total volume in one direction will exceed the limit) or place a Sell Limit order above 5 lots.
The method operates with [the standard volume accuracy](features.htm#volume) (4 decimal places). For extended volume accuracy, use the [IMTConGroupSymbol::VolumeLimitExt](imtcongroupsymbol_volumelimitext.md "VolumeLimitExt") method.
